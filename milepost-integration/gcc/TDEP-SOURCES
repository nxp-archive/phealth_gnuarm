This is a list of source files that have to be compiled target-architecture
dependent.
Mostly this are passes that operate on rtl; passes that work on rtl are
included without checking for evidence that they actually depend on the
target architecture, since they could reasonably depend on it, and
changing the dependencies and build system all the time for what should
be implementation choices seems to promote too much churn.
Some utility modules are also included because they depend on things
like FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER.
genmodes.c and read-rtl.c area also included because they depend on
NUM_MACHINE_MODES.
??? NUM_MACHINE_MODES is now uniform.

VOIDmode and BLKmode are assumed to be constant.
BITS_PER_UNIT must also be unchanging; otherwise we'd have to redefine trees
size meansures to be independent of BITS_PER_UNIT.

// FIXME: originally planned to generate insn-* files that use #ifdef EXTRA_TARGET / #ifdef EXTRA_TARGET_XXX to select the right content; is there still any use for EXTRA_TARGET_XXX ?
// FIXME: gty handling needs to be unified.
