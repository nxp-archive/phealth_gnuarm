/* This file implements optimizations with goal to transform the loop so that
   testing of the ending condition is as cheap as possible.  Concretely:

   -- loop reversal.  Loops are reversed if
      1) they can be
	   -- data dependences are OK
	   -- number of iterations of the loop can be determined
      2) it won't spoil the code
	   -- on targets where traversing arrays in forward direction is more
	      profitable, we do not make more arrays to be traversed backwards.
	   -- initial values of ivs for the new loop are not too costly to
	      compute.
      3) it is usefull
           -- there is an induction variable whose initial value is a constant,
	      such that this iv may be used in the exit test.  And there is no
	      iv whose final value would be a nicer constant such that this iv
	      is used for anything else but the exit test.

   -- condition shape selection.  We try to transform the condition so that it
      performs compare with zero, which often is less expensive, or make the
      value compared with simpler:
      -- if we compare an induction variable X with value BASE - STEP * i
         ((signed) STEP > 0), whose final value V satisfies
	 -STEP <= V < 0 and whose initial value satisfies (signed) BASE >= 0,
	 we use (signed) X >= 0 compare.
      -- if X = BASE + STEP * i and final value V is of shape V' + C, where
         0 < C <= STEP, and there is no overflow, then we use
	 X <= V' compare.
      -- otherwise we use X != V compare.
      
   TODO: implement loop reversal
	 addition removal in condition shape selection
	 use information about bounds on number of iterations in condition
	   shape selection  */
