This is libgcj: the runtime library for gcj, the GNU Compiler for Java. 
libgcj provides a partial implementation of the Java Class Libraries.

libgcj is free software.  See the file COPYING.LIB for copying permission.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

All documentation, including detailed installation and usage instructions,
can be found on the gcj web pages at the following URL:

		http://sourceware.cygnus.com/java/


QUICK INSTALLATION
==================

  > mkdir build
  > cd build
  > ../libgcj/configure --enable-java-gc=<GC TYPE> \
    --enable-threads=<THREADS TYPE>
  > make
  > make install

where:

<GC TYPE> specifies the Garbage Collection library to be used by libgcj. 
Currently the only supported value is "boehm".

<THREADS TYPE> specifies the threads library to be used by libgcj. Currently 
the possible values are "posix" and "none". This value must be the same as
the value used when configuring gcc itself.

Consult the gcj web pages for additional "configure" arguments.

NOTE: libgcj can not be configured/built in the source directory. You must
create a separate build directory.
