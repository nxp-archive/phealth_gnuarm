/* This file gathers information about how statics that are local to
   the compilation unit are used.  It is to be run after the call
   graph is built and after inlining decisions have been made.

   First each function and static variable initialization is analyzed
   to determine which local static variables are either read, written,
   or have their address taken.  Any local static that has its address
   taken is removed from consideration.  Once the local read and
   writes are determined, a transitive closure of this information is
   performed over the call graph to determine the worst case set of
   side effects of each call.  In later parts of the compiler, these
   local and global sets are examined to make the call clobbering less
   traumatic, promote some statics to registers, and improve aliasing
   information.
   
   As a direct result of the information gathered here, the
   TREE_READONLY bits can be set and TREE_ADDRESSABLE can be cleared
   for all compilation unit level static variables that satisfy those
   criteria.

   Lastly, all of this information is used to mark functions as being
   either const (TREE_READONLY) or pure (DECL_IS_PURE).

   This must be run after inlining decisions have been made since
   otherwise, the local sets will not contain information that is
   consistent with post inlined state.  The global sets are not prone
   to this problem since they are by definition transitive.  */
