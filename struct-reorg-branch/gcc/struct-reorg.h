      distance that tells the amount of memory accessed in this basic

 * Field access profiling for structure reorganization
    The structure reorganization optimization is profile directed.
    Following is the part responsible for extracting the field access
    profiling information out of the basic block profiling that is
    currently available in GCC.  And the part responsible for representing
    that information in a graph called the Close Proximity Graph or CPG
    in short.
 * Close proximity graph
    The CPG is a relation graph for fields of a structure that we are
    interested in reorganizing its definition.  A node in the graph
    represents a struct field.  An edge between two nodes represents the
    close proximity relation between two fields.  The close proximity
    between two fields is the couple (count, average distance).  The count
    is the number of times one field access is followed immediately (wrt
    other fields of same struct) by an access to the other field
    (symmetrically).  The distance is the number of memory access
    instructions (not to other fields) that comes in between the two
    consecutive accesses.  Function calls should also be taken into
    account, we should distinguish between function calls that have many
    accesses to memory and others that have only small number of accesses
    to memory.  Inter procedural analysis could be used to make accurate
    decisions.  The distances are normalized by the following equation to
    produce the average:
        ____
        \
        /    distance(i) x count(i)
        ----
         n
        ----------------------------
           ____
           \
           /    count(i)
           ----
            n
