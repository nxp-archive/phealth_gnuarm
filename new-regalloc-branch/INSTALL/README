This directory has been obsoleted for GCC snapshots and CVS access.

Instead check out the toplevel "wwwdocs" module as a sibling of
your "gcc" tree or read these files via the GCC web site
<http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/>.

Copies of the relevant files will be copied into this directory
for releases.
