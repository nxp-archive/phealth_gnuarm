/* This file contains definitions for language-independent
   parameters.  The DEFPARAM macro takes 4 arguments:

     - The enumeral corresonding to this parameter.

     - The name that can be used to set this parameter using the 
       command-line option `--param <name>=<value>'.

     - A help string explaining how the parameter is used.

     - A default value for the parameter.  */

/* The maximum number of instructions accepted for inlining a
   function.  Increasing values mean more agressive inlining.

   inline (or methods defined within the class definition for C++).
   The default value of 10000 is arbitrary but high to match the
   previously unlimited gcc capabilities.  */
