/* Function vect_determine_vectorization_factor

   Determine the vectorization factor (VF). VF is the number of data elements
   that are operated upon in parallel in a single iteration of the vectorized
   loop. For example, when vectorizing a loop that operates on 4byte elements,
   on a target with vector size (VS) 16byte, the VF is set to 4, since 4
   elements can fit in a single vector register.
   
   We currently support vectorization of loops in which all types operated upon
   are of the same size. Therefore this function currently sets VF according to
   the size of the types operated upon, and fails if there are multiple sizes
   in the loop.
         
   VF is also the factor by which the loop iterations are strip-mined, e.g.:
   original loop:
        for (i=0; i<N; i++){
          a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
        }

   vectorized loop:
        for (i=0; i<N; i+=VF){
          a[i:VF] = b[i:VF] + c[i:VF];
        }

   Some forms of scalar cycles are not yet supported.

   Example1: reduction: (unsupported yet)

              for (i=0; i<N; i++)

              for (i=0; i<N; i++)
                 a[i] = i;

                 a[i] = b[i];

         even though it has a def-use cycle caused by the induction variable i:

                    a[i_2] = ...;
                    i_1 = i_2 + 1;
                    GOTO loop;

         because the def-use cycle in loop3 is considered "not relevant" - i.e.,
         it does not need to be vectorized because it is only used for array
         indexing (see 'mark_stmts_to_be_vectorized'). The def-use cycle in
         loop2 on the other hand is relevant (it is being written to memory).

/* Function vect_enhance_data_refs_alignment

   This pass will use loop versioning and loop peeling in order to enhance
   the alignment of data references in the loop.

   FOR NOW: we assume that whatever versioning/peeling takes place, only the
   original loop is to be vectorized; Any other loops that are created by
   the transformations performed in this pass - are not supposed to be
   vectorized. This restriction will be relaxed.

   This pass will require a cost model to guide it whether to apply peeling
   or versioning or a combination of the two. For example, the scheme that
   intel uses when given a loop with several memory accesses, is as follows:
   choose one memory access ('p') which alignment you want to force by doing
   peeling. Then, either (1) generate a loop in which 'p' is aligned and all
   other accesses are not necessarily aligned, or (2) use loop versioning to
   generate one loop in which all accesses are aligned, and another loop in
   which only 'p' is necessarily aligned.

   ("Automatic Intra-Register Vectorization for the Intel Architecture",
   Aart J.C. Bik, Milind Girkar, Paul M. Grey and Ximmin Tian, International
   Journal of Parallel Programming, Vol. 30, No. 2, April 2002.)

   Devising a cost model is the most critical aspect of this work. It will
   guide us on which access to peel for, whether to use loop versioning, how
   many versions to create, etc. The cost model will probably consist of
   generic considerations as well as target specific considerations (on
   powerpc for example, misaligned stores are more painful than misaligned
   loads).

   Here are the general steps involved in alignment enhancements:

     -- original loop, before alignment analysis:
        for (i=0; i<N; i++){
          x = q[i];                     # DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = unknown
          p[i] = x;                     # DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unknown

        }

     -- After vect_compute_data_refs_alignment:
        for (i=0; i<N; i++){
          x = q[i];                     # DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 3
          p[i] = x;                     # DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unknown
        }

     -- Possibility 1: we do loop versioning:
     if (p is aligned) {
        for (i=0; i<N; i++){    # loop 1A
          x = q[i];                     # DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 3
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = 0
	}
     }
     else {
        for (i=0; i<N; i++){    # loop 1B
          x = q[i];                     # DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 3
          p[i] = x;                     # DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unaligned
        }
     }

     -- Possibility 2: we do loop peeling:
     for (i = 0; i < 3; i++){   # (scalar loop, not to be vectorized).
        x = q[i];
        p[i] = x;
     }
     for (i = 3; i < N; i++){   # loop 2A
        x = q[i];                       # DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 0
        p[i] = x;                       # DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unknown
     }

     -- Possibility 3: combination of loop peeling and versioning:
     for (i = 0; i < 3; i++){   # (scalar loop, not to be vectorized).
        x = q[i];
        p[i] = x;
     }
     if (p is aligned) {
	for (i = 3; i<N; i++){	# loop 3A
	  x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 0
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = 0
	}
     }
     else {
        for (i = 3; i<N; i++){  # loop 3B
          x = q[i];                     # DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 0
          p[i] = x;                     # DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unaligned

     These loops are later passed to loop_transform to be vectorized. The
     vectorizer will use the alignment information to guide the transformation
     (whether to generate regular loads/stores, or with special handling for
     misalignment).  */

	 (case 1)
           If USE is used only for address computations (e.g. array indexing),
           which does not need to be directly vectorized, then the
           liveness/relevance of the respective DEF_STMT is left unchanged.

	 (case 2)
           If STMT has been identified as defining a reduction variable, then
	   we have two cases:
	   (case 2.1)
	     The last use of STMT is the reduction-variable, which is defined
	     by a loop-header-phi. We don't want to mark the phi as live or
	     relevant (because it does not need to be vectorized, it is handled
             as part of the vectorization of the reduction), so in this case we
	     skip the call to vect_mark_relevant.
	   (case 2.2)
	     The rest of the uses of STMT are defined in the loop body. For
             the def_stmt of these uses we want to set liveness/relevance
             as follows:
               STMT_VINFO_LIVE_P (DEF_STMT_info) <-- false
               STMT_VINFO_RELEVANT_P (DEF_STMT_info) <-- true
             because even though STMT is classified as live (since it defines a
             value that is used across loop iterations) and irrelevant (since it
             is not used inside the loop), it will be vectorized, and therefore
             the corresponding DEF_STMTs need to marked as relevant.

     The vectype of this new stmt (i.e., the vector type that is used when 
     vectorizing the stmt), is obtained by:
        get_vectype_for_scalar_type (TREE_TYPE (X)).
     Usually we record this vectype in STMT_VINFO_VECTYPE. This field 
     is used (1) when creating the vector version of the stmt, and (2) when 
     determining the vectorization factor.

     However, there are some computation-idioms for which the vectype that is 
     used for vectorization cannot be used to determine the vectorization 
     factor, because it consists of a different number of elements than the 
     actual number of elements that are being operated upon in parallel.  
     So far we have this situation only in cases of reduction patterns: 
     	X = pattern_expr (arg0, arg1, ..., X)
     in which the type of the reduction variable X is 
     different than the type of the other arguments to the stmt.

     For example, consider an accumulation of shorts into an int accumulator. 
     On some targets it's possible to vectorize this pattern operating on 8
     short's at a time (hence, the vectype for purposes of determining the
     vectorization factor should be V8HI); on the other hand, the vectype that
     is used to create the vector form is actually V4SI (the type of the 
     result). 

     In STMT_VINFO_VECTYPE we record the vectype that indicates what is the
     actual level of parallelism (V8HI in the example), so that the subsequent 
     analyses passes will be able to derive the right vectorization factor.
     This means that the following:
      STMT_VINFO_VECTYPE == get_vectype_for_scalar_type (TREE_TYPE (X))
     doesn't hold for reduction patterns.
     Therefore in the transformation routines for reduction patterns,
     we don't use the vectype recorded in STMT_VINFO_VECTYPE, but get the
     vectype from the type of the result (X).

/* Function vect_pattern_recog

   Input:
   LOOP_VINFO - a struct_loop_info of a loop in which we want to look for
	computation idioms.

   Output - for each computation idiom that is detected we insert a new stmt
	that provides the same functionality and that can be vectorized. We
	also record some information in the struct_stmt_info of the relevant
	stmts, as explained below through an example:

   At the entry to this function we have the following stmts, with the
   following initial value in the STMT_VINFO fields:

         stmt                     in_pattern_p	related_stmt	vec_stmt
         S1: a_i = ....			false
         S2: a_2 = ..use(a_i)..		false
         S3: a_1 = ..use(a_2)..		false
         S4: a_0 = ..use(a_1)..		false
         S5: ... = ..use(a_0)..		false


   Say the sequence {S1,S2,S3,S4} was detected as a pattern that can be
   represented by a single stmt. We then:
   - create a new stmt S6 that will replace the pattern.
   - insert the new stmt S6 before the last stmt in the pattern
   - fill in the STMT_VINFO fields as follows:

                                  in_pattern_p	related_stmt	vec_stmt
         S1: a_i = ....			true
         S2: a_2 = ..use(a_i)..		true
         S3: a_1 = ..use(a_2)..		true
       > S6: a_new = ....		false	S4
         S4: a_0 = ..use(a_1)..		true	S6
         S5: ... = ..use(a_0)..		false

   (the last stmt in the pattern (S4) and the new pattern stmt (S6) point
    to each other through the RELATED_STMT field).

   S6 will be marked as relevant in vect_mark_stmts_to_be_vectorized instead
   of S4 because it will replace all its uses.  Stmts {S1,S2,S3} will
   remain irrelevant unless used by stmts other than S4.

   If vectorization succeeds, vect_transform_stmt will skip over {S1,S2,S3}
   (because they are marked as irrelevent). It will vectorize S6, and record
   a pointer to the new vector stmt VS6 both from S6 (as usual), and also 
   from S4. We do that so that when we get to vectorizing stmts that use the
   def of S4 (like S5 that uses a_0), we'll know where to take the relevant
   vector-def from. S4 will be skipped, and S5 will be vectorized as usual:

                                  in_pattern_p	related_stmt	vec_stmt
         S1: a_i = ....         	true            
         S2: a_2 = ..use(a_i).. 	true    
         S3: a_1 = ..use(a_2).. 	true    
       > VS6: va_new = ....	
         S6: a_new = ....       	false	S4		VS6
         S4: a_0 = ..use(a_1).. 	true	S6		VS6
       > VS5: ... = ..vuse(va_new)..
         S5: ... = ..use(a_0).. false   

   DCE could then get rid of {S1,S2,S3,S4,S5,S6} (if their defs are not used
   elsewhere), and we'll end up with:

	VS6: va_new = .... 
	VS5: ... = ..vuse(va_new)..

   If vectorization does not succeed, DCE will clean S6 away (its def is
   not used), and we'll end up with the original sequence.
