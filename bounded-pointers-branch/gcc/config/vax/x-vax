# If compiling GCC with the Unix compiler and assembler, -J will handle
# functions with branch instructions longer than 32k bytes.  The Unix
# compiler passes the -J argument onto the assembler.  The Unix assembler
# requires it to resolve jumps when byte-displacement branches are
# insufficient.  GAS ignores -J but automatically extends branches as
# necessary.  GCC ignores -J as well (warning).  Thus, another mechanism
# is needed to pass -J when using GCC.  The -Wa,-J option can't be used
# directly since it is not compatible with the Unix compiler.  The current
# solution is to use ASM_SPEC to pass -J to the assembler.
X_CFLAGS = -J
