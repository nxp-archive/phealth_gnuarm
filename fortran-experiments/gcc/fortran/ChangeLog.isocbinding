2007-02-21  Christopher D. Rickett  <crickett@lanl.gov>

	* fortran/symbol.c: Whitespace fixes.
	* fortran/decl.c: Ditto.

2007-02-21  Christopher D. Rickett  <crickett@lanl.gov>
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/c_loc_tests_2.f03: New test case for
	the c_loc function.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/bind_c_implicit_vars.f03: New test
	case for warning user about implicitly typed variables if they
	need to be C interoperable.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/interop_params.f03: Updated test case
	to change the expected line of the warning messages.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/bind_c_array_params.f03: New test case
	to verify that gfortran reports errors if the user declares
	assumed-shape or deferred-shape dummy arguments for a BIND(C)
	procedure.  Only assumed-size or explicitly-shaped arrays are
	allowed.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/bind_c_dts_2.f03: New test case that
	shows gfortran accepting a BIND(C) derived type that contains
	another BIND(C) derived type.  This was previously reported as an
	error.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/binding_label_tests_2.f03: New test
	case to verify that gfortran reports error messages for invalid
	binding labels (error in the NAME= specifier).
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/binding_label_tests.f03: New test case
	for verifying that gfortran accepts all valid binding labels.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/bind_c_dts_3.f03: New test case for
	verifying that gfortran correctly checks BIND(C) derived types
	that are nested within another BIND(C) derived type for being C
	interoperable.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/iso_c_binding_rename_1_driver.c: Main
	program for the iso_c_binding_rename_1 test.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/iso_c_binding_rename_1.f03: New test
	case to check that gfortran allows the symbols in iso_c_binding to
	be renamed.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/iso_c_binding_rename_2_driver.c: Main
	program for the iso_c_binding_rename_2 test.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/iso_c_binding_rename_2.f03: New test
	case to check that gfortran allows the symbols in iso_c_binding to
	be renamed.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/bind_c_dts_2_driver.c: Main program
	for the bind_c_dts_2 test case.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/bind_c_usage_2.f03: Updated test case.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/c_loc_tests_2_funcs.c: C functions
	that go with c_loc_tests_2.f03.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/bind_c_usage_3.f03: Updated test case.
	* fortran/symbol.c: Added warnings for implicitly typed
	variables that need to be C interoperable.  Added
	get_iso_c_binding_dt() for retrieving derived types from
	namespace, independent of the type name.  Changed
	verify_bind_c_derived_type to allow type components.  Updated
	warning/error messages in many cases to not use the *_now
	versions.  Removed dead code: gen_c_interop_kind_sym,
	gen_given_kinds, gen_c_interop_int_kinds,
	gen_c_interop_logical_kinds, gen_c_interop_real_kinds,
	gen_special_c_chars, gen_c_interop_char_kinds,
	gen_c_interop_ptr_syms, gen_c_interop_ptr_kinds, gen_iso_c_proc,
	gen_c_interop_int_funcs, gen_c_interop_kinds.  These were removed
	because they have not been necessary since FX added the
	generate_isocbinding_symbol function.  Updated functions to use
	the from_intmod and intmod_sym_id instead of the symbol names.
	This allows the symbols to be renamed by the user.  Added the
	derived types for c_ptr and c_funptr to the namespace
	derived_types list.
	* fortran/decl.c: Updated warning/error messages.  Added test
	cases for preventing assumed-shape and deferred-shape arrays as
	parameters to BIND(C) procedures.  Removed verification of C
	interoperability because it is now done during resolve_sym().
	Added an error check for binding labels where a name specifier was
	given with a zero lengthed string.
	* fortran/gfortran.h: Updated prototypes.
	* fortran/module.c: Added code to put from_intmod and
	intmod_sym_id in the module file.  This is needed to correctly
	recognize renamed iso_c_binding module symbols.
	* fortran/trans-types.c: Updated to use from_intmod and
	intmod_sym_id instead of the names for iso_c_binding symbols c_ptr
	and c_funptr.
	* fortran/resolve.c: Added test in resolve_contained_functions
	to verify the return type of functions that are BIND(C).  Use
	from_intmod and intmod_sym_id to recognize iso_c_binding symbols
	instead of their names.  Added checks to resolve_symbol to verify
	C interoperability for symbols that need to be.  This use to be
	done in decl.c, but it was pointed out that this could be too
	early to check.
	* fortran/match.c: Updated gfc_match_name_C to handle leading
	or trailing spaces in the name specifier.
	* fortran/match.h: Updated prototypes.  Moved some to
	gfortran.h.

2007-02-14  Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>

	* fortran/decl.c (build_sym): Remove VALUE check.
	* fortran/resolve.c (resolve_symbol): Add VALUE check.
	* gfortran.dg/value_5: New test.

2007-02-02  Christopher D. Rickett  <crickett@lanl.gov>
	* gfortran.dg/c_kind_tests_2.f03: New test case for
	verifying C interoperable kinds for BIND(C) variables.
	* gfortran.dg/interop_params.f03: New test case for verifying
	C interoperable kinds for dummy args to BIND(C) routines.
	* fortran/symbol.c: Modified call to verify_c_interop in
	verify_bind_c_derived_type to give args for component name and
	location.
	* fortran/decl.c: Modified calls to verify_c_interop to give
	args for symbol name and location.  Slightly changed a couple
	warning messages.  Removed validation of C kind from
	gfc_match_kind_spec.  Added validation of C kind to
	verify_c_interop.  Removed the verification of C interoperability in  
	build_sym since it is done in variable_decl.  Modified checks on
	BIND(C) derived types to include errors for the definition and any
	variable declared with it.
	* fortran/gfortran.h: Changed the prototype for
	verify_c_interop to take args for the symbol/component name and
	location.  These are used for an error message if the validation
	of the C kind fails.


2007-01-24  Christopher D. Rickett  <crickett@lanl.gov>

	* libgfortran/intrincsics/iso_c_binding.h: Fix comments.
	Remove c_null_ptr and c_null_funptr prototypes.

2007-01-24  Christoper D. Rickett  <crickett@lanl.gov>

	* fortran/symbol.c: Removed javadoc style comment blocks and
	converted to GNU style.  Also, put the function type and name on
	separate lines.  Removed commented out return in
	verify_bind_c_derived_type.
	* fortran/decl.c: Converted javadoc to GNU style for functions
	and put the function return type and name on separate lines.
	* fortran/trans-types.c: Ditto on commenting style.
	* fortran/resolve.c: Ditto on commenting style.  Also,
	combined two if statements in gfc_iso_c_sub_interface.
	* fortran/match.c: Ditto on commenting style.
	* fortran/trans-decl.c: Ditto on commenting style.
	* fortran/misc.c: Ditto on commenting style.
	* gfortran.dg/bind_c_usage_3.f03: New test.
	* gfortran.dg/c_ptr_tests_5.f03: Ditto.


2007-01-21  Francois-Xavier Coudert  <coudert@clipper.ens.fr>

	* gfortran.h: Add new fields from_intmod and intmod_sym_id to the
	gfc_symbol structure, to keep track of symbols coming from
	intrinsic modules so we can special-case them when needed.
	* symbol.c (generate_isocbinding_symbol): Set these new fields.
	* module.c: Set these new fields, and use the fact that we know
	have a symbolic id per symbol to rework the code dealing with
	ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.

2007-01-19  Christopher D. Rickett

	* decl.c: Fixed bugs in verifying BIND(C) variables
	and C interoperable kinds.  Modified the way errors for each are
	handled in some cases.
	* gfortran.h: Changed the return type of verify_bind_c_derived_type(). 
	* module.c: Added the ts.f90_type field to the module file. 
	* match.h: Changed the return types of
	verify_com_block_vars_c_interop() and verify_bind_c_sym().
	* libgfortran/intrinsics/iso_c_binding.h: Removed the declarations
	of c_null_ptr and c_null_funptr.
	* symbol.c (generate_isocbinding_symbol): Added function calls for
	generating c_null_ptr and c_null_funptr.
	* gcc/fortran/symbol.c: Fixed bugs in c_null_ptr/c_null_funptr.
	Changed the way errors were handled for checking BIND(C) variables.

	* options.c (form_from_filename): Added entry for .f03/.F03 extensions.
	* trans-expr.c (gfc_conv_function_call): Whitespace.
	* gfortran.dg/bind_c_usage_2.f03: New test.
	* gfortran.dg/c_ptr_tests.f03: Ditto.
	* gfortran.dg/kind_tests_2.f03: Ditto.
	* gfortran.dg/kind_tests_3.f03: Ditto.
