   COND is the condition code for the controlling predicate.  It must
   be one of { <, >, <=, >= }

   INCR is the loop index increment.  It must be tree node of type
   tcc_constant.

   PRE_BODY is a landing pad filled by the gimplifier with things from
   INIT, COND, and INCR that are technically part of the OMP_FOR
   structured block, but are evaluated before the loop body begins.
