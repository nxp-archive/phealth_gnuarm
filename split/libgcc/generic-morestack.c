   *PFRAME_SIZE is the size of the required stack frame--the returned
   stack must be at least this large.  On function exit *PFRAME_SIZE

   while this function is running).  OLD_STACK is saved so that it can
   be returned by a later call to __generic_releasestack.  PARAM_SIZE
   is the size in bytes of parameters to copy to the new stack.  This
   function returns a pointer to the new stack segment, pointing to
   the memory after the parameters have been copied.  The returned
   value minus the returned *PFRAME_SIZE (or plus if the stack grows
   upward) is the first address on the stack which should not be used.
