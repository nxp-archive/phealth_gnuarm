/* This implements a goto elimination pass based on the GIMPLE representation.
   The original algorithm was described by Ana M. Erosa and Laurie J. Hendren.
   This implementation follows this algorithm and does not generate breaks.
   Logical variables are declared in the function's outermost scope such that
   they are visible in the whole function.  Thier initial value is set at false.
   When a GOTO_STMT is reached, then its logical variable switches to 'ON' and
   the flow control is switched on an "express way" to the corresponding
   LABEL_STMT.  On this "express way" there are only comparisons like '(T != 0)'
   introduced by this pass, and no other instructions are executed.  Then once
   the flow reached its destination, the logical variable is set to 'OFF' and the
   control flow is switched on its normal way.  The total number of such
   comparisons depends on the number of goto statements and on the nesting level
   of the label/goto statements.
   An interesting thing in the goto elimination is that after this pass the
   control flow graph (CFG) becomes regular, and optimisations that were
   disabled can be applied after this pass.

   In fact this pass does nothing else than complete the implicitly specified
   control flow.  When a programmer uses a goto, he implicitly specifies that
   the code between the GOTO_STMT and the corresponding target LABEL_STMT is
   not executed.  This pass adds the necessary code to complete the
   specification of the control flow.  The control flow becomes explicit.

   As described in the documentation of the McCAT compiler, the algorithm
   uses a hash table of LABEL_STMTs and a list of GOTO_STMTs.

   [SWITCH|BREAK|CONTINUE]_STMTs are not handled by the current implementation
   and have to be transformed before this pass (break_continue_elimination pass).
