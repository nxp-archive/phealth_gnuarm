/* Next functions define the transformation from the simple linked statement
   chain to the double linked statement chain and an interface that allows 
   operations on it.  
   This implementation is based on the fact that 'type' field is not used for 
   representing statement nodes.  The PREV_STMT pointer is stored in the 'type' 
   field, the NEXT_STMT is just an alias for TREE_CHAIN.  That makes the 
   interface used to walk trees closer to RTL interface.  */
