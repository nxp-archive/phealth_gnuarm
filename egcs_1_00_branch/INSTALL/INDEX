			Installing egcs-1.00

This document describes the generic installation procedure for egcs as well as
detailing some target specific installation instructions for egcs. 

egcs includes several components that previously were separate distributions
with their own installation instructions. This document supercedes all package
specific installation instructions. We provide the component specific
installation information in the source distribution for historical reference
purposes only. 

We recommend you read the entire generic installation instructions as well as
any target specific installation instructions before you proceed to configure,
build, test and install egcs. 

If something goes wrong in the configure, build, test or install procedures,
first double check that you followed the generic and target specific
installation instructions carefully. Then check the FAQ to see if your problem
is covered before you file a bug report. 

The installation procedure is broken into four steps. 

     configure 		CONFIGURE
     build 		BUILD
     test (optional) 	TEST
     install 		FINALINSTALL

Before starting the build/install procedure please browse the host/target specific installation notes (SPECIFIC).
