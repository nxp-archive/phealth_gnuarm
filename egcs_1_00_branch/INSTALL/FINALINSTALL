Final install egcs-1.00

Now that egcs has been built and tested, you can install it with
"cd objdir; make install". 

That step completes the installation of egcs; user level binaries can be found 
in prefix/bin where prefix is the value you specified with the --prefix to
configure (or /usr/local by default). 

If you don't mind, please send egcs@cygnus.com a short mail message
indicating that you successfully built and installed egcs. Include the output
from running srcdirconfig.guess. 

If you find a bug in egcs, please report it to egcs-bugs@cygnus.com.
