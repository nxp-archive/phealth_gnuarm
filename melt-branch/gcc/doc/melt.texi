@cindex Middle End Lisp Translator


The MELT branch introduces a Lisp dialect to express middle-end analysers. 
This chapter describes the dialect and how to use it.
A working knowledge of Scheme or Lisp is presupposed.

MELT was formerly known as Basilys, hence many functions or variables
have basilys in their name, and the conventional file extensions for
MELT source files is @code{.bysl}

See the @uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/MiddleEndLispTranslator,,MELT wiki page}

@cindex MELT overview

Any MELT enabling compilation is really a long lasting compilation. It
is supposed that you use a powerful workstation (or laptop) with
enough memory (at least 4Gigabytes of RAM is receommended on a 64 bits
machine like x86-64), and that the MELT-enabled compilation will run a
lot slower than a simple @code{gcc -O1} compilation (hopefully doing
some useful stuff). Notice that a MELT compilation actually generates
C code, compile it (using another GCC compilation process) to a
dynamically loadable library, and load its into the MELT compilation
process.

@c some sentences copied from the Wiki page. I (Basile) wrote all of them.

The MELT branch contains several (related) stuff. Everything can be
enabled or disabled at GCC configure time or at GCC run time:

@enumerate

@item a compiler probe, which enable an advanced user to display some of
the compilers internals data (but not to change them or change the
GCC compiler's behavior.

@item a Lisp dialect compiled into C code, with which one can code
sophisticated or prototypical middle end passes.

@item a runtime which extends the GCC infrastructure to support the
previous items, in particular a generational copying garbage
collector well suited for the lisp dialect above, which is build
above the existing GGC (which deals with old values).

@end enumerate

MELT is bootstrapped, in the sense that the translation from the MELT
dialect to C is coded in MELT (hence the MELT generated C code is
available from the source code).

The generated C code is including only one file @code{run-basilys.h}
which includes many GCC include files internal to the compiler. It is
compiled into a dynamic library by a shell script
@code{*melt-cc-script*} which invokes the host GCC with appropriate
flags.

MELT obviously need that the binary (dynamic libraries @code{warm*.so})
for the MELT translator are already available. More generally, it uses
several kind of files:

@enumerate

@item the script used to compile generated C files info dynamically loadable stuff.
This script may be invoked by MELT GCC. In common cases, the first
argument to the script is the MELT generated input @code{*.c} file and
the second argument is the MELT loaded output @code{*.so} dynamic
library.

@item an include directory (passed by @code{-I} to the compiler) 
containing all the useful GCC headers. This directory is only written by
the installation procedure.

@item a permanent generated C code directory which contains some essential files, in particular the C form of the MELT translated.
 
@end enumerate


@c =======================================================================
@node Building the MELT branch
@section Building the MELT branch
@cindex Building the MELT branch

The MELT branch has to be configured appropriately to enable MELT. If
MELT is disabled at configure time, the MELT branch is essentially the
GCC trunk. Enabling MELT means passing the @code{-with-ppl --with-ltdl
--enable-compiler-probe --enable-basilysmelt} flags to the toplevel
@code{configure}.

Actually, there are two different features enabled: the compiler probe
and MELT. In practice, you'll need both.

To compile the MELT branch, you need the libtool dynamic loader and
the Parma Polyhedra Library. The libtool dynamic loader wraps the
dynamic library loading functions like @code{dlopen} or @code{dlsym};
it is part of @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool,,libtool}
(version 2.x). The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) is a free library
available @uref{http://www.cs.unipr.it/ppl/,,here}, it is a C++
library (GPLv3 licensed) handling lattices like intervals etc. Also,
the host compiler (the compiler which compiles the source code of
GCC), also used to compile MELT generated C code during MELT enabled
@code{gcc} execution, should be some version of @code{gcc} (preferably
a 4.x version at least).

Note that currently MELT is only compiled on Linux machines.

@c =======================================================================
@node Invoking MELT
@section Invoking MELT
@cindex Invoking MELT

Without any MELT specific program flags, the MELT variant of gcc
behave as the trunk. So to get or use MELT features, you need to pass
some special flags. Most of these flags are starting with
@code{-fbasilys}. They for the middle-end of GCC so are common for
every source language (ie @code{gcc}, @code{g++} ... commands) and
target.

MELT is usually invoked while compiling a (C, C++, ...) source file
but may occasionnally be invoked without compiling any source input to
perform tasks which are not related to a particular GCC input source
file. In particular, the translation of a MELT file @code{foo.bysl}
into C code @code{foo.c} is done with a special invocation like
@code{gcc -fbasilys=compilefile
-fbasilys-arg=foo.bysl -fbasilys-secondarg=foo.c} (possibly with other
options like some appropriate @code{-fbasilys-init=}). In other words,
the MELT translator to C @emph{is not} a gcc front-end.

The table below lists all MELT specific options, in alphabetical order.

@table @gcctabopt
@item -fbasilys=
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys=}
@opindex fbasilys
This flag (without argument) is required for every MELT enabled
compilation. If it is not given, no MELT specific processing is done.
If given, this gives the command to be executed before any MELT
passes. It uses the @code{:sysdata_cmd_fundict} field of
@code{INITIAL_SYSTEM_DATA} internal object of MELT to determine the
MELT function applied to execute the command. If this application
returns nil, no GCC compilation occur (i.e. no @code{*.c} or
@code{*.cc} etc... source file is read). Hence, some commands may be
used for their side-effects. In particular, the compilation of MELT
lisp source file @code{*.bysl} into C code @code{*.c} is done this
way.

@item -fbasilys-arg=
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys-arg=}
@opindex fbasilys-arg=
This gives the first argument string to MELT. It is incompatible with
the @code{-fbasilys-arglist=} option.

@item -fbasilys-arglist=
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys-arglist=}
@opindex fbasilys-arglist=
This gives the first argument list of strings to MELT. It is
incompatible with the @code{-fbasilys-arg=} option. The string program
argument is split into a list of strings using the comma
separator. For example, @code{-fbasilys-arglist=1,BB,3} makes a
three-element list argument with first string @code{1}, second string
@code{BB} and third string @code{3}. There is no way to give a
string subargument containing a comma.


@item -fbasilys-compile-script=
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys-compile-script=}
@opindex fbasilys-compile-script=
This sets the compile script (default is @code{melt-compile-script}
somewhere inside GCC files) used to compile MELT generated C code into
dynamically loaded stuff. The script is usually invoked by GCC with
two arguments: the C file generated by MELT and the dynamic library
(e.g. a @code{*.so} or @code{*.la}) to be generated by the
script. Notice that MELT generates huge C files (containing, in
addition of a routine for each MELT function, a very big
initialization routine), so it is recommended to avoid compiling these
generated files with @code{-O3}.

@item -fbasilys-debug
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys-debug}
@opindex fbasilys-debug
This flag has no argument and asks for lot of debugging output. It is
only useful to debug MELT and is unrelated to the @code{-g} flag
asking GCC to output debug information.

@item -fbasilys-debugskip=
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys-debugskip=}
@opindex fbasilys-debugskip=
This flag (only useful with @code{-fbasilys-debug}) has an integer
argument. When @code{-fbasilys-debug} is given with
@code{-fbasilys-debugskip=1000} the first thousand debug messages are
skipped, so are not printed.

@item -fbasilys-gensrcdir=
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys-gensrcdir=}
@opindex fbasilys-gensrcdir=
This flag sets the directory containing MELT generated C files.

@item -fbasilys-gdbmstate=
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys-gdbmstate=}
@opindex fbasilys-gdbmstate=
This flag sets the GDBM indexed file containing global state. It
should always be specified when needed, because there is no default.

@item -fbasilys-init=
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys-init=}
@opindex fbasilys-init=
This flag sets the initial MELT modules. They are separated by
semi-colons or (on Unix only) colons. So @code{-fbasilys-init=foo:bar}
or @code{'-fbasilys-init=foo;bar'} (quotes are useful for the shell
running GCC) load first the @code{foo} module and then the @code{bar}
module. A module starting with an at sign @code{@@} is handled as a
module list file. The @code{.modlis} extension is added, and then a
file is seeked by that name. This file is read line by line (with
empty or blank lines skipped, and comment lines starting with an hash
@code{#} skipped). Each line is the name of a module do be load in
sequence. For example, @code{-fbasilys-init=@@mylist:bar} with a file
@file{mylist.modlis} containing
@example
# file mylist.modlis ; just a comment
alpha
beta
@end example
would have the same effect as @code{-fbasilys-init=alpha:beta:bar}. 
Notice that modules are seeked in several directories.

@item -fbasilys-tempdir=
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys-tempdir=}
@opindex fbasilys-tempdir=
@end table
This flags sets the temporary MELT directory. If specified it is not
cleaned. If it does not exist, it is mkdir-ed and cleaned. Avoid
setting it to a non-empty directory.

This section has to be written.

As in all Lisps, parenthesis are important, so @code{a} and @code{(a)}
do not mean the same thing. The first stuff after an opening
parenthesis has usually an operator or syntactic keyword role.

MELT is a Lisp dialect translated into (unreadable, or at least
unfriendly) C code. Some MELT constructs are related to this C
translatability.

@node Lexical MELT conventions
@subsection Lexical MELT conventions

It is recommended to edit MELT files with a Lisp-aware editor
(e.g. the GNU emacs Lisp mode).

As in Lisp dialects:

@itemize @bullet

@item parenthesis 
are essential and should be matched. It is an error to add extra right
parenthesis.

@item brackets 
are like parenthesis but should be matched (but you probably don't
want to use them). @code{[a b]} is the same as @code{(a b)} but botn
@code{[a b)} and @code{(a b]} are incorrect.

@item comments 
start with a semicolon (@code{;}) to the end of the line. This is the
prefered way to put comments in MELT file.

@item block comments 
start with hash-bar (@code{#|}), may take several lines, and end with
bar-hash (@code{|#}). Don't nest block comments.

@item space 
characters are token sepators, but indentation does not matter (we
strongly recommend the MELT code to be properly indented, e.g. using
Emacs Lisp mode, for readability purposes).

@item case 
is insensitive; words, i.e. identifiers and keywords are all converted
to uppercases.

@item strings 
are denoted like in C between double quotes, with backslashes escaping
(eg double-backslash @code{\\} to represent a single backslash,
backslash doublequote @code{\"} to represent a doublequote, backslash t
@code{\t} for a tab, , and @code{\xfe} to represent the character
coded 0xfe in hex, etc. In addition, a backslash-leftbrace @code{ \@{
} read verbatim all characters up to the first rightbrace @code{ @}
}. A string with the last doublequote followed by an underscore like
@code{"do that"_} is localized using the @code{gettext} host system
function; this could be useful for some user messages (to be
translated to other languages like french).

@item symbols
 (i.e. identifiers) are case insensitive and may contain non
alphanumerical characters like @code{_+-*/<>=!?:%~&@@$}. It is advised
to use these special characters sparingly. Symbols cannot start with
any of @code{?%}. Because symbols are related to their C translation,
is advised to avoid digits after underscores in symbols like
@code{x_12} and to have each symbol contain at least one letter
(e.g. use @code{<i} instead of @code{<}).

@item the quote character 
@code{'} is special. @code{'x} is parsed the same as @code{(quote x)}.

@item the backquote character 
@code{`} is special. @code{`x} means the same as @code{(backquote x)}

@item the comma character 
@code{,} is special. So @code{,x} means @code{(comma x)} and @code{,(a
b)} is @code{(comma (a b))}

@item the question mark chararacter 
@code{?} is special when is is the first of a token (it may appear
inside a symbol otherwise). For instance, @code{?x} means
@code{(question x)} but @code{x?} is a symbol of two characters. So
@code{?y?} is bad taste but means @code{(question y?)}

@item the hash character 
@code{#} is special. In particular, @code{#|} starts multiline
comments; @code{#\space} is the integer code of the space character;
@code{#b10} is a binary number (i.e. two), @code{#o12} is octal (ie
ten), @code{#xffff} is hexadecimal number (ie 65535).

@item braces 
@code{@{} and @code{@}} are special.


@item numbers
are integers in decimal like @code{-123} or @code{+22} or
@code{33}. Notice that @code{1.2} is illegal; it is not a floating
point number.

@item colons 
(i.e. @code{:}) starts constant (lisp-like) keywords which always evaluate to themselves.

@end itemize

Contrarily to some or most other Lisp dialects:

@itemize @minus

@item don't use the dot 
for cons-ing, e.g. @code{(a b . c)} is not legal.

@item strings 
may contain escaped braces with special verbatim-like meaning.

@item a string 
whose ending doublequote is immediately followed by an underscore
(e.g. @code{"example of international"_}) is localized by calling
@code{gettext} at read time.

@end itemize


@c =======================================================================

@node Main MELT syntax
@subsection Main MELT syntax.

We list each key symbol in alphabetical order and provide a short
derscription. Lisp familiarity is required.

@table @code

@item and
@cindex @code{and} MELT syntax
@code{(and @var{e1} @var{e2} @var{e3})} is (like in all Lisps) used
for sequential conjunction; it is the same as @code{(if @var{e1} (if
@var{e2} @var{e3}))}.

@item assert_msg
@cindex @code{assert_msg} MELT syntax
@cindex @code{assert_failed} MELT primitive
@code{(assert_msg @var{msg} @var{check})} aborts when @var{check} is
false (using the @code{assert_failed} primitive, giving the source file
position) and displays the given @var{msg}, when GCC is built for
debugging with @code{ENABLE_CHECK}. If GCC is not built for debugging,
neither operand is used. The entire @code{assert_msg} expression
evaluates to nil.

@item comment
@cindex @code{comment} MELT syntax
@code{(comment @var{msg})} evaluates to nil and output the @var{msg}
as a C comment in the C translation. Don't use @code{*/} or @code{*/}
in @var{msg}. When a @code{comment} appears at the beginning of a MELT
compilation unit, it appears at the beginning of the generated C file;
this is useful for making copyright notices appear both in the MELT
source file and the generated C code.

@item compile_warning
@cindex @code{compile_warning} MELT syntax
@code{(compile_warning @var{msg} @var{exp})} evaluates like @var{exp} but also
emits a message at MELT compilation time. Intended use is similar to
@code{#warning} in C.

@item cond
@cindex @code{cond} MELT syntax
@code{(cond @var{condition1} @var{condition2} @var{...})} is -like in
all Lisps- a conditional evaluation. Each condition is
@code{(@var{test} @var{then1} @var{then2} @var{...} @var{thenk})} so
the @var{test} is evaluated. If it is true, all the @var{then}s are
evaluated in sequence, and the last is the result of the whole
@code{cond} expression. The last condition can be @code{(:else
@var{else1} @var{...} @var{elsek})}; if no previous test succeeded,
all the @var{else}s are sequentially evaluated, and the last of them
is the whole @code{cond} result. Notice that @code{(cond (@var{test1}
@var{then1}) (@var{test2} @var{then2a} @var{then2b}) (:else
@var{else1} @var{else2} @var{else3}))} is the same as @code{(if
@var{test1} @var{then1} (if @var{test2} (progn @var{then2a}
@var{then2b}) (progn @var{else1} @var{else2})))}.

@item cppif
@cindex @code{cppif} MELT syntax
[for experts] @code{(cppif @var{name} @var{then-cpp} @var{else-cpp})} is translated
using a C directive @code{#if @var{name}} to the translation of
@var{then-cpp} or @var{else-cpp}.

@item current_module_environment_container
@cindex @code{current_module_environment_container} MELT syntax
[for experts] @code{(current_module_environment_container)} evaluates
to an object of @code{CLASS_CONTAINER} containing the current module
environment.

@item debug_msg
@cindex @code{debug_msg} MELT syntax
@code{(debug_msg @var{expv} @var{msg} @var{[count]})} -where the
@var{[count]} expression is usually ommitted- is useful for debugging
ouput of the value of @var{expv} (with the @code{-fbasilys-debug}
program option) to output, using the @code{debug_msg_fun}
function. The entire @code{debug_msg} expression is somehow equivalent
to @code{(cppif ENABLE_CHECKING (debug_msg_fun @var{expv msg count
filename lineno}) ())} and evaluates to nil.

@item defciterator
@cindex @code{defciterator} MELT syntax
@code{(defciterator @var{iter-name} @var{start-formals}
@var{state-symbol} @var{local-formals} @var{before-expansion}
@var{after-expansion})} define a C-iterator named @var{iter-name}. The
@var{start-formals} is a [binding] list of formal arguments [given to
the C-iterator].  The @var{state-symbol} is usable in the expansions,
where it is expanded to a unique C identifier. The @var{local-formals}
is a [binding] list of variables local to the expanded block. The
@var{before-expansion} and @var{after-expansion} are lists of items
like strings (appearing as is in the C expansion) or symbols (either
from the start formals, or the local formals, or the state symbol).
