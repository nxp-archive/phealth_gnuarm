@cindex Middle End Lisp Translator


The MELT branch introduces a Lisp dialect to express middle-end analysers. 
This chapter describes the dialect and how to use it.
A working knowledge of Scheme or Lisp is presupposed.

MELT was formerly known as Basilys, hence many functions or variables
have basilys in their name, and the conventional file extensions for
MELT source files is @code{.bysl}

See the @uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/MiddleEndLispTranslator,,MELT wiki page}

@cindex MELT overview

Any MELT enabling compilation is really a long lasting compilation. It
is supposed that you use a powerful workstation (or laptop) with
enough memory (at least 4Gigabytes of RAM is receommended on a 64 bits
machine like x86-64), and that the MELT-enabled compilation will run a
lot slower than a simple @code{gcc -O1} compilation (hopefully doing
some useful stuff). Notice that a MELT compilation actually generates
C code, compile it (using another GCC compilation process) to a
dynamically loadable library, and load its into the MELT compilation
process.

@c some sentences copied from the Wiki page. I (Basile) wrote all of them.

The MELT branch contains several (related) stuff. Everything can be
enabled or disabled at GCC configure time or at GCC run time:

@enumerate

@item a compiler probe, which enable an advanced user to display some of
the compilers internals data (but not to change them or change the
GCC compiler's behavior.

@item a Lisp dialect compiled into C code, with which one can code
sophisticated or prototypical middle end passes.

@item a runtime which extends the GCC infrastructure to support the
previous items, in particular a generational copying garbage
collector well suited for the lisp dialect above, which is build
above the existing GGC (which deals with old values).

@end enumerate

MELT is bootstrapped, in the sense that the translation from the MELT
dialect to C is coded in MELT (hence the MELT generated C code is
available from the source code).

The generated C code is including only one file @code{run-basilys.h}
which includes many GCC include files internal to the compiler. It is
compiled into a dynamic library by a shell script
@code{*melt-cc-script*} which invokes the host GCC with appropriate
flags.

MELT obviously need that the binary (dynamic libraries @code{warm*.so})
for the MELT translator are already available. More generally, it uses
several kind of files:

@enumerate

@item the script used to compile generated C files info dynamically loadable stuff.
This script may be invoked by MELT GCC. In common cases, the first
argument to the script is the MELT generated input @code{*.c} file and
the second argument is the MELT loaded output @code{*.so} dynamic
library.

@item an include directory (passed by @code{-I} to the compiler) 
containing all the useful GCC headers. This directory is only written by
the installation procedure.

@item a permanent generated C code directory which contains some essential files, in particular the C form of the MELT translated.
 
@end enumerate


@c =======================================================================
@node Building the MELT branch
@section Building the MELT branch
@cindex Building the MELT branch

The MELT branch has to be configured appropriately to enable MELT. If
MELT is disabled at configure time, the MELT branch is essentially the
GCC trunk. Enabling MELT means passing the @code{-with-ppl --with-ltdl
--enable-compiler-probe --enable-basilysmelt} flags to the toplevel
@code{configure}.

Actually, there are two different features enabled: the compiler probe
and MELT. In practice, you'll need both.

To compile the MELT branch, you need the libtool dynamic loader and
the Parma Polyhedra Library. The libtool dynamic loader wraps the
dynamic library loading functions like @code{dlopen} or @code{dlsym};
it is part of @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool,,libtool}
(version 2.x). The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) is a free library
available @uref{http://www.cs.unipr.it/ppl/,,here}, it is a C++
library (GPLv3 licensed) handling lattices like intervals etc. Also,
the host compiler (the compiler which compiles the source code of
GCC), also used to compile MELT generated C code during MELT enabled
@code{gcc} execution, should be some version of @code{gcc} (preferably
a 4.x version at least).

Note that currently MELT is only compiled on Linux machines.

@c =======================================================================
@node Invoking MELT
@section Invoking MELT
@cindex Invoking MELT

Without any MELT specific program flags, the MELT variant of gcc
behave as the trunk. So to get or use MELT features, you need to pass
some special flags. Most of these flags are starting with
@code{-fbasilys}. They for the middle-end of GCC so are common for
every source language (ie @code{gcc}, @code{g++} ... commands) and
target.

MELT is usually invoked while compiling a (C, C++, ...) source file
but may occasionnally be invoked without compiling any source input to
perform tasks which are not related to a particular GCC input source
file. In particular, the translation of a MELT file @code{foo.bysl}
into C code @code{foo.c} is done with a special invocation like
@code{gcc -fbasilys=translatefile -fbasilys-arg=foo.bysl
-fbasilys-secondarg=foo.c} (possibly with other options like some
appropriate @code{-fbasilys-init=}). It is possible but deprecated to
invoke with @code{-fbasilys=compilefile} instead of
@code{-fbasilys=translatefile}. In other words, the MELT translator to
C @emph{is not} a GCC front-end, like e.g. @code{g++} is a C++
front-end of GCC.

The table below lists all MELT specific options, in alphabetical order.

@table @gcctabopt
@item -fbasilys=
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys=}
@opindex fbasilys
This flag is required for every MELT enabled compilation. If it is not
given, no MELT specific processing is done.  If given, this gives the
command to be executed before any MELT passes. It uses the
@code{:sysdata_cmd_fundict} field of @code{INITIAL_SYSTEM_DATA}
internal object of MELT to determine the MELT function applied to
execute the command. If this application returns nil, no GCC
compilation occur (i.e. no @code{*.c} or @code{*.cc} etc... source
file is read). Hence, some commands may be used for their
side-effects. In particular, the compilation of MELT lisp source file
@code{*.bysl} into C code @code{*.c} is done this way.

@item -fbasilys-arg=
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys-arg=}
@opindex fbasilys-arg=
This gives the first argument string to MELT. It is incompatible with
the @code{-fbasilys-arglist=} option.

@item -fbasilys-arglist=
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys-arglist=}
@opindex fbasilys-arglist=
This gives the first argument list of strings to MELT. It is
incompatible with the @code{-fbasilys-arg=} option. The string program
argument is split into a list of strings using the comma
separator. For example, @code{-fbasilys-arglist=1,BB,3} makes a
three-element list argument with first string @code{1}, second string
@code{BB} and third string @code{3}. There is no way to give a
string subargument containing a comma.


@item -fbasilys-compile-script=
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys-compile-script=}
@opindex fbasilys-compile-script=
This sets the compile script (default is @code{melt-compile-script}
somewhere inside GCC files) used to compile MELT generated C code into
dynamically loaded stuff. The script is usually invoked by GCC with
two arguments: the C file generated by MELT and the dynamic library
(e.g. a @code{*.so} or @code{*.la}) to be generated by the
script. Notice that MELT generates huge C files (containing, in
addition of a routine for each MELT function, a very big
initialization routine), so it is recommended to avoid compiling these
generated files with @code{-O3}.

@item -fbasilys-debug
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys-debug}
@opindex fbasilys-debug
This flag has no argument and asks for lot of debugging output. It is
only useful to debug MELT and is unrelated to the @code{-g} flag
asking GCC to output debug information.

@item -fbasilys-debugskip=
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys-debugskip=}
@opindex fbasilys-debugskip=
This flag (only useful with @code{-fbasilys-debug}) has an integer
argument. When @code{-fbasilys-debug} is given with
@code{-fbasilys-debugskip=1000} the first thousand debug messages are
skipped, so are not printed.

@item -fbasilys-gensrcdir=
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys-gensrcdir=}
@opindex fbasilys-gensrcdir=
This flag sets the directory containing MELT generated C files.

@item -fbasilys-gdbmstate=
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys-gdbmstate=}
@opindex fbasilys-gdbmstate=
This flag sets the GDBM indexed file containing global state. It
should always be specified when needed, because there is no default.

@item -fbasilys-init=
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys-init=}
@opindex fbasilys-init=
This flag sets the initial MELT modules. They are separated by
semi-colons or (on Unix only) colons. So @code{-fbasilys-init=foo:bar}
or @code{'-fbasilys-init=foo;bar'} (quotes are useful for the shell
running GCC) load first the @code{foo} module and then the @code{bar}
module. A module starting with an at sign @code{@@} is handled as a
module list file. The @code{.modlis} extension is added, and then a
file is seeked by that name. This file is read line by line (with
empty or blank lines skipped, and comment lines starting with an hash
@code{#} skipped). Each line is the name of a module do be load in
sequence. For example, @code{-fbasilys-init=@@mylist:bar} with a file
@file{mylist.modlis} containing
@example
# file mylist.modlis ; just a comment
alpha
beta
@end example
would have the same effect as @code{-fbasilys-init=alpha:beta:bar}. 
Notice that modules are seeked in several directories.

@item -fbasilys-tempdir=
@gccoptlist{-fbasilys-tempdir=}
@opindex fbasilys-tempdir=
@end table
This flags sets the temporary MELT directory. If specified it is not
cleaned. If it does not exist, it is mkdir-ed and cleaned. Avoid
setting it to a non-empty directory which may contain files named like
MELT modules.

@node Tutorial about MELT
@section Tutorial about MELT
@cindex Tutorial about MELT


As in all Lisps, parenthesis are important, so @code{a} and @code{(a)}
do not mean the same thing. The first stuff after an opening
parenthesis has usually an operator or syntactic keyword role.

MELT is a Lisp dialect translated into (unreadable, or at least
unfriendly) C code. Some MELT constructs, and some MELT limitations
(e.g. lack of tail-recursion) are related to this C
translatability. The MELT translator is itself written in MELT (files
@file{gcc/melt/warmelt-*.bysl}) and is bootstrapped; the translated C
files are in @file{gcc/warmelt-*-0.c}; they are quite big and are
distributed with the GCC source code; use the @code{upgrade-warmelt}
target of @file{gcc/Makefile.in} to regenerate these C translations.

MELT is closely related to GCC internal passes and internal middle-end
representations and runtime. Hence (in contrast to other LISP
dialects) @emph{MELT is dealing with both boxed values and unboxed
stuff} (e.g. plain @code{long} integers as in C, but also @code{tree}s
and @code{gimple}s, etc..., as inside GCC, separating them using their
@emph{ctype}). Keep always in mind the boxed versus unboxed
distinction. Because of that, and because of GCC runtime (in
particular the GGC garbage collector), MELT is neither polymorphic
(you cannot deal with unboxed stuff like with boxed values) nor
polytopic (no variable arguments facility).

Some familiarity with other Lisp dialects and with GCC internals is
required to code in MELT.

The MELT runtime contains a copying generational garbage collector
-GC- implemented in @file{gcc/basilys.c}, backed up by the previously
existing GCC ordinary (precise, marking) garbage collector GGC. The
MELT-specific copying GC is designed for efficiency (but requires a
very specific C coding style, easy to achieve in generated C code, but
uncumfortable for human C developers), and handles well quick
allocation of many short-lived objects [which is not a goald of
GGC]. Therefore, @emph{don't be afraid of allocating a lot of values}
inside MELT code.

@node Reserved MELT syntax and symbols
@subsection Reserved MELT syntax and symbols

The following symbols have specific MELT meaning. Use them only as
described here and avoid redefining them.
@code{and assert_msg comment compile_warning cond cppif
current_module_environment_container debug_msg defciterator defclass
definstance defprimitive defselector defun exit export_class

redefinition_handling return setq store_predefined unsafe_get_field
unsafe_put_fields update_current_module_environment_container}

Also avoid symbols starting with @code{def}

@node Primitives in MELT
@subsection Primitives in MELT

A MELT primitive defines an operator by specifying how to translate
into C each of its invocation. As a simple example, the less-than
integer operator @code{<i} is defined as
@lisp
(defprimitive <i                ; define the primitive 
  (:long                        ; next formal arguments are longs
   a b)                         ; the two formal arguments
  :long                         ; the type of the result (also long)
  "((" a ") < (" b "))")        ; how to expand into C code
@end lisp

@cindex unboxed MELT stuff
@cindex ctype in MELT
Note that the above primitive accepts raw long integers (exactly the C
@code{long} type) and returns such a long integer [0 if
@code{((a)<(b))} was false in the C sense, and non-zero, perhaps -1,
if it was true]. We say that such integers are @emph{unboxed} stuff
(we don't speak of values in that case). The symbol @code{:long}
represents the C type @code{long} and we call it a @emph{ctype}.

@node Lexical MELT conventions
@subsection Lexical MELT conventions

It is recommended to edit MELT files with a Lisp-aware editor
(e.g. the GNU emacs Lisp mode).

As in Lisp dialects:

@itemize @bullet

@item parenthesis 
are essential and should be matched. It is an error to add extra right
parenthesis.

@item brackets 
are like parenthesis but should be matched (but you probably don't
want to use them). @code{[a b]} is the same as @code{(a b)} but both
@code{[a b)} and @code{(a b]} are incorrect.

@item comments 
start with a semicolon (@code{;}) to the end of the line. This is the
prefered way to put comments in MELT file.

@item block comments 
start with hash-bar (@code{#|}), may take several lines, and end with
bar-hash (@code{|#}). Don't nest block comments.

@item space 
characters are token sepators, but indentation does not matter (we
strongly recommend the MELT code to be properly indented, e.g. using
Emacs Lisp mode, for readability purposes).

@item case 
is insensitive; words, i.e. identifiers and keywords are all converted
to uppercases.

@item strings 
are denoted like in C between double quotes, with backslashes escaping
(eg double-backslash @code{\\} to represent a single backslash,
backslash doublequote @code{\"} to represent a doublequote, backslash t
@code{\t} for a tab, , and @code{\xfe} to represent the character
coded 0xfe in hex, etc. In addition, a backslash-leftbrace @code{ \@{
} read verbatim all characters up to the first rightbrace @code{ @}
}. A string with the last doublequote followed by an underscore like
@code{"do that"_} is localized using the @code{gettext} host system
function; this could be useful for some user messages (to be
translated to other languages like french).

@item symbols
 (i.e. identifiers) are case insensitive and may contain non
alphanumerical characters like @code{_+-*/<>=!?:%~&@@$}. It is advised
to use these special characters sparingly. Symbols cannot start with
any of @code{?%}. Because symbols are related to their C translation,
is advised to avoid digits after underscores in symbols like
@code{x_12} and to have each symbol contain at least one letter
(e.g. use @code{<i} instead of @code{<}).

@item the quote character 
@code{'} is special. @code{'x} is parsed the same as @code{(quote x)}.

@item the backquote character 
@code{`} is special. @code{`x} means the same as @code{(backquote x)}

@item the comma character 
@code{,} is special. So @code{,x} means @code{(comma x)} and @code{,(a
b)} is @code{(comma (a b))}

@item the question mark chararacter 
@code{?} is special when is is the first of a token (it may appear
inside a symbol otherwise). For instance, @code{?x} means
@code{(question x)} but @code{x?} is a symbol of two characters. So
@code{?y?} is bad taste but means @code{(question y?)}

@item the hash character 
@code{#} is special. In particular, @code{#|} starts multiline
comments; @code{#\space} is the integer code of the space character;
@code{#b10} is a binary number (i.e. two), @code{#o12} is octal (ie
ten), @code{#xffff} is hexadecimal number (ie 65535).

@item braces 
@code{@{} and @code{@}} are special.


@item numbers
are integers in decimal like @code{-123} or @code{+22} or
@code{33}. Notice that @code{1.2} is illegal; it is not a floating
point number.

@item colons 
(i.e. @code{:}) starts constant (lisp-like) keywords which always evaluate to themselves.

@end itemize

Contrarily to some or most other Lisp dialects:

@itemize @minus

@item don't use the dot 
for cons-ing, e.g. @code{(a b . c)} is not legal.

@item strings 
may contain escaped braces with special verbatim-like meaning.

@item a string 
whose ending doublequote is immediately followed by an underscore
(e.g. @code{"example of international"_}) is localized by calling
@code{gettext} at read time.

@subsubsection MELT formals

A formal argument list is a possibly empty list (between
parenthesis). This list contains either ctype keywords or formal
names. A ctype keyword apply to all further formals (until another
ctype keyword, or end of formal arguments list. Ctypes have a keyword
and are each described by a predefined instance (of
@code{CLASS_CTYPE}) with a name conventionnally starting with
@code{ctype_}.
@cindex ctype MELT keyword
[For experts: to add a new ctype, define a @code{BGLOB_CTYPE_*}
predefined in @file{gcc/basilys.h} and an instance in

regenerate all the @file{gcc/warmelt-*.c} files]

@node MELT ctypes
@subsubsection MELT ctypes

Here are the list of ctype-s.
@cindex ctype in MELT

@itemize
@item @code{:value} (ctype instance @code{ctype_value})
This ctype is for MELT [boxed] values. It is the default ctype of arguments.

@item @code{:long} (ctype instance @code{ctype_long})
This ctype is for unboxed long integers; it is also used for conditions and tests.

@item @code{:tree} (ctype instance @code{ctype_tree})
This ctype is for GCC @code{tree} raw pointers, as in @file{gcc/tree.h}.

@item @code{:gimple} (ctype instance @code{ctype_gimple})
This ctype is for GCC @code{gimple} raw tuple pointers, as in @file{gcc/gimple.h}.

@item @code{:gimpleseq}  (ctype instance @code{ctype_gimple})
This ctype is for GCC @code{gimple_seq} raw pointers, representing
sequences of gimple instructions, as in @file{gcc/gimple.h}

@item @code{:basicblock}  (ctype instance @code{ctype_basicblock})
This ctype is for GCC @code{basic_block} raw pointers, representing
basic blocks, as in @file{gcc/basic-block.h}

@item @code{:edge}  (ctype instance @code{ctype_edge})
This ctype is for GCC @code{edge} raw pointers, representing edges of
the control flow graph, as in @file{gcc/basic-block.h}

@item @code{:void}  (ctype instance @code{ctype_void})
This ctype is the same as C @code{void} type. It should not be the
type of formal arguments. It is only useful as the result type of
side-effecting primitives.

@item @code{:cstring} (ctype instance @code{ctype_cstring})
This ctype is only for constant strings (like @code{const char[]} in
C). It is not possible to build an unboxed @code{:cstring}. Every
@code{:cstring} variable may only be bound to constant strings (not to
something inside some heap).

@end itemize

MELT formal arguments appear in @code{lambda defun defprimitive
defciterator multicall} forms. The first formal argument of
@code{defun lambda multicall} constructs should -if given- be a
@code{:value}. Ctype-s also appear in @code{let} bindings.

The @code{:value} ctype is the only ctype for boxed values. Every
other ctype is for unboxed stuff.


@node MELT boxed values
@subsubsection MELT boxed values

@cindex minor MELT garbage collection
@cindex full MELT garbage collection
@cindex values in MELT
@cindex boxed values in MELT

Most data manipulated by MELT code are values. Values are allocated in
the nursery generation of MELT heap, and are later (if alive) copied
into GGC heap. A @emph{minor MELT garbage collection}, which runs
quickly and often, only copies live values (in particular, local
variables of MELT functions) out of the nursery, into the GGC heap. A
@emph{full MELT garbage collection} also invokes the GGC collector, so
scans the entire heap.

MELT boxed values can be one of:

@itemize

@item nil
@cindex nil MELT value
(represented by the C @code{NULL} pointer and noted @code{()} in MELT)
is a value. It is the initial or default value everywhere.

@item multiples 
@cindex multiple MELT value
(or MELT tuples) - they are a fixed array of values agglomerated as a
multiple.

@item closures
@cindex closure MELT value
(or MELT functional values) represent a functional value, containing a
routine and closed values; the only way of making closures is thru the
@code{lambda} and @code{defun} syntactic constructs.

@item routines
@cindex routine MELT value
are the reification of MELT functions (generated internally).

@item lists
@cindex list MELT value
are singly linked lists of pairs. Efficient access to the first and
last pair of the list are provided. Unlike in many other Lisps, lists
are not simply pairs (but implemented as the grouping of the first and
last pair contained in the list), so appending a list to another one,
or a single value at the beginning or the end of a list, is a simple
operation. Lists are never circular and have a finite length.

@item pairs
@cindex pair MELT value
are like CONS pairs in most other Lisps. In particular, a list knows
its first and last pair. The head of a pair is an arbitrary boxed
value, but its tail is a pair or nil. 

@item triples
@cindex triple MELT value
(rarely used) have arbitrary head and middle values, but the tail is a
triple or nil. They could be used like A-lists' nodes in Lisp.

@item integers
@cindex integer MELT value
(are actually boxed longs).

@item strings
@cindex string MELT value
(are like boxed cstrings; they are immutable, so the characters inside
them do not change; they are terminated by a null byte, like in C).

@item string-buffers
@cindex string-buffer MELT value
(are mutable buffers of strings and may grow appropriately; they are a
bit like C++ string streams).

@item boxes
@cindex box MELT value
(like references in ML, are mutable boxed containers).

@item objects
@cindex object MELT value
have values in their fields (or slots) and are described below; each
MELT object has a class (which is also a MELT object), which are
organized in a single-inheritance class hierarchy rooted at
@code{CLASS_ROOT}.

@item mixints
@cindex mixints MELT value
are mixing an arbitrary mutable MELT value and an integer.

@item mixlocs
@cindex mixlocs MELT value
(for experts; they are mixing an arbitrary mutable MELT value and a
@code{location_t} indicating a location inside e.g. a MELT or C source
file).

@item object maps
@cindex object map MELT value
are an hashtable association between MELT objects and arbitrary MELT
non-null [boxed] values.

@item string maps
@cindex string map MELT value
are an hashtable dictionnary mapping strings to arbitrary non-null
MELT values.

@item boxed ctypes
@cindex boxed ctype MELT value
Each @emph{ctype} has its boxed representation, which is a value
containing the raw (unboxed) @emph{ctype} like @code{gimple} etc..

@item boxed ctype maps
@cindex boxed ctype map MELT value
Each @emph{ctype} [except @code{:long :void :cstring}] has its boxed
map, an hash table associating (non-null) stuff of the given ctype
with arbitrary non-null MELT [boxed] values. For example, a gimple map
associate GCC @code{gimple}s to arbitrary MELT non-null values
(usually MELT objects). This is very useful to represent a
relationship (conceptually an attribute) between @code{gimple}s and
MELT values such as objects without having to enhance the definition
of the @code{gimple} structure inside @file{gcc/gimple.h}

@item special values
@cindex special MELT values
They are useful to represent stuff like MPFR things (arbitrary
precision numbers), PPL coefficients, etc... The MELT runtime is able
to run a sort of destructing C function when a special value is no
more used, so the handling of special values is more expensive than
for other values.

@end itemize

Adding additional MELT value types require enhancing the
@file{gcc/basilys.h} and @file{gcc/basilys.c} files.

@cindex discriminant for MELT values
Each MELT [boxed] value starts with a @emph{discriminant}. This
discriminant is a MELT object (it cannot be nil). The nil value has
conceptually its own discriminant @code{DISCR_NULLRECV}, but is of
course represented by C @code{NULL} pointer. Discriminants are used by
the garbage collector (precisely to discriminate various MELT boxed
data types using the object number of their discriminant), and by the
MELT message sending machinery (hence messages sent to the nil MELT
value are processed using the @code{DISCR_NULLRECV}
discriminant). Each kind of MELT value has its own discriminant, but
sometimes it is useful to have several discriminants possible for the
same kind of MELT value. For example, MELT strings can have
@code{DISCR_STRING} or @code{DISCR_VERBATIMSTRING} etc., and verbatim
strings are handled specially (in particular when printing them inside
generated C code). Every MELT [boxed] value has an immutable
discriminant, set at the time of the value's creation.

Conventionally MELT non-object values have a primitive to test them
called like @code{is_*}, a primitive to build them called like
@code{make_*} [which takes a discriminant as the first argument], and
the accessing and modifying primitives share a common prefix. In
particular, object maps are tested with @code{is_mapobject}, built
with @code{make_mapobject}, accessed with @code{mapobject_get} and
updated using the @code{mapobject_put} and @code{mapobject_remove}
primitives. For more details, look into file
@file{gcc/melt/warmelt-first.bysl}.


@node MELT objects and classes
@subsubsection MELT objects and classes

@cindex object MELT values
@cindex MELT objects

An important (and common) kind of MELT [boxed] values are MELT
objects. A MELT object contains exactly

@itemize
@item the discriminant or class 
@cindex MELT classes
@cindex class in MELT
of the object; as every [boxed] value, MELT objects starts with a
discriminant; for objects, it is their @emph{class}, which is an
object itself. We say ``@var{Cl} is the class of @var{Ob}'' or
equivalently ``@var{Ob} is a [direct] instance of @var{Cl}'' when
@var{Ob} is a MELT object of discriminant @var{Cl}.

@item the hash code 
of the object is an unsigned non-zero (more or less random, immutable
i.e. fixed) integer, given at object build time (i.e. instanciation
time).

@item the object number 
or @emph{objnum} of the object is a small unsigned short integer. It
is usually assigned at object build time. For discriminants @var{Di},
their objnum is also called the @emph{magic number} of the values
@var{Va} of the given discriminant @var{Di}.

@item the object length
or size is the number of slots or fields of the objects. All objects
@var{Ob} of a given class @var{Cl} have the same fixed number of slots
(no more than 32767 slots and almost always a lot less, e.g. at most a
dozen). Some objects could have a length of 0 (if their class is the
@code{CLASS_ROOT} or has no direct or inherited fields), but this is
very unusual.

@item the object slots 
or object fields are the values contained inside the object. These
fields may be mutable; their number is fixed (it is the object
length).

@end itemize

In practice, every object's slot is described by a field object (of
class @code{CLASS_FIELD}) inside the object's class.

Every discriminant (in particular every class) is an object with the following fields (or slots):
@itemize
@item @code{prop_table}
is the property object map associating objects to values, and usable as a P-list.

@item @code{named_name}
is the boxed string naming the discriminant.

@item @code{disc_methodict}
is an object map associating selectors to closures (method implementations).

@item @code{disc_super}
is the super-discriminant (or the super-class for objects)

@end itemize

The root discriminant is @code{DISCR_ANYRECV}. The discriminant of the
nil value is @code{DISCR_NULLRECV}. Other types of values have
discriminants like @code{DISCR_ANYRECV DISCR_BASICBLOCK DISCR_BOX
DISCR_CHARINTEGER DISCR_CLOSURE DISCR_EDGE DISCR_GIMPLE
DISCR_GIMPLESEQ DISCR_INTEGER DISCR_LIST DISCR_MAPBASICBLOCKS
DISCR_MAPEDGES DISCR_MAPGIMPLES DISCR_MAPGIMPLESEQS DISCR_MAPOBJECTS
DISCR_MAPSTRINGS DISCR_MAPTREES DISCR_METHODMAP DISCR_MIXEDINT
DISCR_MIXEDLOC DISCR_MULTIPLE DISCR_NAMESTRING DISCR_NULLRECV
DISCR_PAIR DISCR_ROUTINE DISCR_SEQCLASS DISCR_SEQFIELD DISCR_STRBUF
DISCR_STRING DISCR_TREE DISCR_VERBATIMSTRING}.  Some discriminants are
specialized by having a meaningful (i.e. not @code{DISCR_ANYRECV})
super-discriminant (i.e. the value inside the @code{:disc_super}
slot). For example, @code{DISCR_METHODMAP} is used for object maps
which are method maps (mapping a selector to a function implementing a
method), instead of the plain @code{DISCR_MAPOBJECTS}.  [For experts:]
It is possible to make additional discriminants using
@code{definstance} with @code{CLASS_DISCR} as the class.

Classes are discriminants, but in addition have the following fields
(or slots):
@itemize
@item @code{class_ancestors}
is the multiple (of discriminant @code{DISCR_SEQCLASS}) of the
classes' ancestors. Testing that a given object has some given class
as its direct class or indirect ancestor is quick (@code{is_a}
primitive in MELT, @code{basilys_is_instance_of} function in C code).

@item @code{class_fields}
is the multiple (of @code{DISCR_SEQFIELD}) of the classes' fields
(both inherited from ancestors or own to the class).

@item @code{class_objnumdescr}
is usable for describing the objnum of instances.

@item @code{class_data}
is an additional slot for holding class data.
@end itemize


Fields are slot descriptors (objects of @code{CLASS_FIELD}), they are
named (so inherit fields @code{prop_table named_name}). Their objnum
is their index, their specific slots are
@itemize
@item @code{fld_ownclass}
gives the class defining the field.
@item @code{fld_typinfo}
can be used for describing the field's type in instances.
@end itemize

Beware that the structure of classes and discriminants is described
not only in @file{warmelt-first.bysl} but also ``built-in'' in files
@code{basilys.c} and @code{basilys.h} so changing them is very tricky.

Fields should have a @emph{globally unique} name. Conventionally,
fields common to the same class share a common prefix for their name.

The @code{defclass} construct builds and fills class and fields
objects. Don't make instances of @code{CLASS_CLASS} or
@code{CLASS_FIELD} otherwise!

Objects are built using the @code{make_instance} construct, or
statically using @code{definstance}. In addition, @code{defselector
defclass} also statically build objects (likes classes and fields).

Exporting a class means exporting the class object and its own fields.

@node MELT function application
@subsubsection MELT function application

Function applications are noted @code{(@var{fun} @var{args}
@var{...})}. There may be no arguments, e.g. just
@code{(@var{fun})}. If arguments are given, the first argument must be
a @code{:value}. So @code{(f 1 x)} is incorrect (because @code{1} is
an unboxed @code{:long}); use @code{(f x 1)} instead. Usually, the
@var{fun}ction is just a variable bound to a function, but it may be a
more complex expression, like @code{((if (p x) f g) x y)} which,
depending on the test @code{(p x)} applies either @code{f} or @code{g}
to @code{x y}.

The application of a non-function returns null. The
@code{basilys_apply} C function doing the application checks that the
applied function is indeed a function (ie a closure). Function
applications are never tail-recursive; they always consume some stack
space.

Named functions are defined using the @code{defun} construct, using a
Common Lisp like syntax (not the Scheme @code{define}). If the formal
arguments list is not empty, its first element (the first formal
argument of a named or anonymous function) should be a @code{:value}.

Functions are not polytopic nor polymorphic; their signature is
essentially fixed. They should expect a fixed number of arguments
[there is no variable argument facility in MELT], each with a defined
ctype (the first argument should be a @code{:value}), and return a
fixed number of results (the first result should be a @code{:value})
each with a defined ctype. An argument which has not the expected
ctype or is missing is initialized to null or 0. Likewise a secundary
result which has not the expected ctype is ignored or set to null or
0.

A function should [always] return a primary result of ctype
@code{:value} and may also return secondary results (using the
@code{return} construct). The only way of getting the secondary
results of a function call (or a message send) is thrue the
@code{multicall} construct, which binds all the results of the call or
send to the formal arguments in the @code{multicall}. Function
applications not done in a @code{multicall} have all their secondary
results (if any) ignored.

@node MELT function abstraction and closures
@subsubsection MELT function abstraction and closures

Function abstraction (i.e. making anonymous functions) is done using
the @code{lambda} construct. @emph{Only values can be closed}, hence
it is not possible to close a non-boxed value, so @code{(let ( (:long
one 1) ) (lambda (a) (f a one)))} is incorrect (and rejected by the
MELT translator).

Actually, every MELT function is really a closure, so @code{defun}
binds a name to the closure which is the named function.


Closures are @code{:value}s. Use the @code{is_closure} primitive to
test tha a given value is indeed a closure. The only way of building
closures is thru @code{lambda} or @code{defun}. Closures contain a
routine pointer (routines are also @code{:values}) and closed
values. [For experts] the size of a closure is available thru the
@code{closure_size} primitive. Its routine is available thru
@code{closure_routine} primitive. To get its n-th closed value, use
the @code{closure_nth} primitive. At MELT runtime, each MELT call
frame for MELT function application (or message sending) knows its
closure.

Routines correspond to MELT generated C functions (with their constant
values).


@node MELT message sending
@subsubsection MELT message sending

A message invocation is done using the construct
@code{(@var{selector-name} @var{reciever} @var{args} @var{...})}. This
construct is syntactically the same as function (or primitive)
application, and is discriminated by the fact that the
@var{selector-name} has been previously defined with
@code{defselector} or is imported as bound to an instance of
@code{CLASS_SELECTOR}. The selector should be such a name and cannot
be an expression. The @var{reciever} can be any @code{:value} (even
null). The @var{args} are optional and can have any ctype (but a
selector should have a fixed and well defined signature). Use
@code{export_values} to export selectors.

A method is just a functional value, installed thru the
@code{install_method} function. This function expects a discriminant
or class, a selector, and a function (the method). Method installation
is very dynamic and can be done at any time.

A message invocation (i.e. an expression starting with a selector) can
be done on any boxed value. If it is an object, its class is used;
otherwise its discriminant is used (so @code{DISCR_NULLRECV} is used
when sending to nil). To send a message of selector @var{sel} (an
instance of @code{CLASS_SELECTOR}) to a reciever @var{recv} of
discriminant (e.g. the class of an object) @var{dis}, the following
procedure is used:

@itemize

@item @var{dis} should be a discriminant;
if it is not an instance of @code{CLASS_DISCR}, stop and do nothing.

@item get the @code{discr_methodmap} slot of @var{dis}; 
it should be an object map (i.e. a ``dictionnary'' of methods) that we
call @var{md}.

@item get the method @var{meth} 
associated to @var{sel} in @var{md}; if @var{meth} is a function
(i.e. a boxed MELT closure), apply @var{meth} to the reciever
@var{recv} and any additional arguments. This ends the message
invocation.

@item otherwise,
no method is found, so replace @var{dis} by its super-discriminant
(its slot @code{disc_super}) and repeat again. Hence, methods are also
looked in superclasses, etc... so are properly inherited.

@end itemize

Notice that message invocation is more dynamic (hence slower) than
e.g. C++ virtual member functions, and that method maps can be
upgraded at any time.

@node MELT syntax constructs
@subsubsection MELT syntax constructs

The table below gives MELT syntax constructs. [Experts can add new
constructs using macros, and implementing appropriate methods in the
MELT translator].

@table @code

@item and
@cindex @code{and} MELT syntax
@code{(and @var{e1} @var{e2} @var{e3})} is (like in all Lisps) used
for sequential conjunction; it is the same as @code{(if @var{e1} (if
@var{e2} @var{e3}))}. Any number (at least one) of conjuncts are
possible.

@item assert_msg
@cindex @code{assert_msg} MELT syntax
@cindex @code{assert_failed} MELT primitive
@code{(assert_msg @var{msg} @var{check})} aborts when @var{check} is
false (using the @code{assert_failed} primitive, giving the source file
position) and displays the given @var{msg}, when GCC is built for
debugging with @code{ENABLE_CHECK}. If GCC is not built for debugging,
neither operand is used. The entire @code{assert_msg} expression
evaluates to nil.

@item comment
@cindex @code{comment} MELT syntax
@code{(comment @var{msg})} evaluates to nil and output the @var{msg}
as a C comment in the C translation. Don't use @code{*/} or @code{*/}
in @var{msg}. When a @code{comment} appears at the beginning of a MELT
compilation unit, it appears at the beginning of the generated C file;
this is useful for making copyright notices appear both in the MELT
source file and the generated C code.

@item compile_warning
@cindex @code{compile_warning} MELT syntax
@code{(compile_warning @var{msg} @var{exp})} evaluates like @var{exp} but also
emits a message at MELT compilation time. Intended use is similar to
@code{#warning} in C.

@item cond
@cindex @code{cond} MELT syntax
@code{(cond @var{condition1} @var{condition2} @var{...})} is -like in
all Lisps- a conditional evaluation. Each condition is
@code{(@var{test} @var{then1} @var{then2} @var{...} @var{thenk})} so
the @var{test} is evaluated. If it is true, all the @var{then}s are
evaluated in sequence, and the last is the result of the whole
@code{cond} expression. The last condition can be @code{(:else
@var{else1} @var{...} @var{elsek})}; if no previous test succeeded,
all the @var{else}s are sequentially evaluated, and the last of them
is the whole @code{cond} result. Notice that @code{(cond (@var{test1}
@var{then1}) (@var{test2} @var{then2a} @var{then2b}) (:else
@var{else1} @var{else2} @var{else3}))} is the same as @code{(if
@var{test1} @var{then1} (if @var{test2} (progn @var{then2a}
@var{then2b}) (progn @var{else1} @var{else2})))}.

@item cppif
@cindex @code{cppif} MELT syntax
[for experts] @code{(cppif @var{name} @var{then-cpp} @var{else-cpp})} is translated
using a C directive @code{#if @var{name}} to the translation of
@var{then-cpp} or @var{else-cpp}.

@item current_module_environment_container
@cindex @code{current_module_environment_container} MELT syntax
[for experts] @code{(current_module_environment_container)} evaluates
to an object of @code{CLASS_CONTAINER} containing the current module
environment.

@item debug_msg
@cindex @code{debug_msg} MELT syntax
@code{(debug_msg @var{expv} @var{msg} [@var{count}])} -where the
@var{count} expression (of ctype @code{:long}) is usually ommitted- is
useful for debugging ouput of the value of @var{expv} (with the
@code{-fbasilys-debug} program option) to output, using the
@code{debug_msg_fun} function. The entire @code{debug_msg} expression
is somehow equivalent to @code{(cppif ENABLE_CHECKING (debug_msg_fun
@var{expv msg count filename lineno}) ())} and evaluates to nil.

@item defciterator
@cindex @code{defciterator} MELT syntax
The form @code{(defciterator @var{iter-name} @var{start-formals}
@var{state-symbol} @var{local-formals} @var{before-expansion}
@var{after-expansion})} defines a C-iterator named
@var{iter-name}. The @var{start-formals} is a [binding] list of formal
arguments [given to the C-iterator].  The @var{state-symbol} is usable
in the expansions, where it is expanded to a unique C identifier. The
@var{local-formals} is a [binding] list of variables local to the
expanded block. The @var{before-expansion} and @var{after-expansion}
are lists of items like strings (appearing as is in the C expansion)
or symbols (either from the start formals, or the local formals, or
the state symbol).

@item defclass
@cindex @code{defclass} MELT syntax
The form @code{(defclass @var{class-name} [:predef @var{predefined}]
[:super @var{superclass-name}] :fields @var{fields-list})} defines a
class named @var{class-name} of super-class named
@var{superclass-name} with the given @var{fields-list} (a list of
field names) and an optional @var{predefined} name (for predefined
classes [giving a @var{predefined} is for experts]).

@item definstance
@cindex @code{definstance} MELT syntax
The form @code{(definstance @var{instance-name} @var{class-name}
[:predef @var{predefined}] [:obj_num @var{object-number}]
@var{:field-name} @var{field-value} @var{...})} statically defines an
instance of name @var{instance-name} of the class
@var{class-name}. [expert usage: a @var{predefined} name and an
@var{object-number} may also be given].

@item defprimitive
@cindex @code{defprimitive} MELT syntax
The form @code{(defprimitive @var{primitive-name}
@var{formals-arglist} @var{ctype} @var{expansion} @var{...})}
statically defines a C primitive named @var{primitive-name} of a given
@var{formals-list} and given return @var{ctype}. The @var{expansion}-s
are either strings or formal names.

@item defselector
@cindex @code{defselector} MELT syntax
The form @code{(defprimitive @var{selector-name} @var{selector-class}
@var{:field-name} @var{field-value} @var{...})} defines a
selector. Usually @var{selector-class} is @code{CLASS_SELECTOR}, and
no other @var{field}s are given. Once a name is bound to a selector,
every further occurrence of that name in operator position is
considered as a message invocation.

@item defun
@cindex @code{defun} MELT syntax
The form @code{(defun @var{function-name} @var{formals-list}
@var{body} @var{...})} define a function named
@code{function-name}. The ctype of the first (if any) formal argument
(in the @var{formals-list}) should be a @code{:value}. The
@code{function-name} can appear in the given @var{body} (for
recursion).

@item exit
@cindex @code{exit} MELT syntax
The form @code{(exit @var{loop-label} @var{expr} @var{...})}, only
used inside @code{forever} loops, causes the lexically enclosing
@code{forever} loop named by @var{loop-label} to be exited, after
evaluation of the @var{expr}s. The last such value (or nil if no
@var{expr} is given) is the result returned by the @code{forever}
loop. @code{exit} forms are similar to Ada's @code{exit} or C
@code{break} (not to @code{longjmp}). The @code{exit} should be local
to the containing procedure: it cannot jump across @code{lambda}s.

@item export_class
@cindex @code{export_class} MELT syntax
The form @code{(export_class @var{class-name} @var{...})} export all
the given @var{class-name}s and their fields.

@item export_macro
@cindex @code{export_macro} MELT syntax
[For experts] The form @code{(export_macro @var{macro-symbol}
@var{expander})} exports a macro binding for the given
@var{macro-symbol} with the @var{expander} function (which takes as
arguments the source expression (of @code{CLASS_SEXPR}), the
environment (of @code{CLASS_ENVIRONMENT}), the expander produces an
instance of a subclass of @code{CLASS_SRC}. The macro
@code{macro-symbol} is defined in the environment exported by the
current module, so is available in other modules only.

@item export_values
@cindex @code{export_values} MELT syntax
The form @code{(export_values @var{exported-name} @var{...})} export
all the names, as values, given as arguments.

@item fetch_predefined
@cindex @code{fetch_predefined} MELT syntax
[For experts] @code{(fetch_predefined @var{predefined-name-or-number})}

@item forever
@cindex @code{forever} MELT syntax
@code{(forever @var{label-name} @var{body} @var{...})}  when
evaluated, the bodies are evaluated in sequence, and indefinitely
re-evaluated again. The only way of getting out from a @code{forever}
loop is with @code{exit} (using the given @var{label-name}, lexically
inside the body) or @code{return}

@item if
@cindex @code{if} MELT syntax
@code{(if @var{test} @var{then-exp} [@var{else-exp}])}. When
evaluated, the @var{test} is first evaluated. If it is true, the
@var{then-exp} is evaluated and is the result of the whole
@code{if}. If it is false (either 0 if ctype-d @code{:long}, or the
null pointer for @code{:value} and other ctypes), the optional
@var{else-exp} is evaluated (or 0 or null) and is the result of the
whole @code{if}.

@item lambda
@cindex @code{lambda} MELT syntax
@code{(lambda @var{formal-args} @var{body} @var{...})} is a function
abstraction, it returns a closure, the anonymous function taking
@var{formal-args} as arguments and evaluating sequentially the
@var{body} expressions, returning the value of the last one. The first
argument of a function and the first result that it is returning
should be a @code{:value}.
