@chapter MELT (Middle End Lisp Tranlator)
@cindex MELT
@cindex Middle End Lisp Translator


The MELT branch introduces a Lisp dialect to express middle-end analysers. 
This chapter describes the dialect and how to use it.
A working knowledge of Scheme or Lisp is presupposed.

MELT was formerly known as Basilys, hence many functions or variables
have basilys in their name, and the conventional file extensions for
MELT source files is @code{.bysl}

See the @uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/MiddleEndLispTranslator,,MELT wiki page}
