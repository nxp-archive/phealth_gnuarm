## file melt/README.melt in melt-branch of GCC

Please read the wiki page on http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/MiddleEndLispTranslator
and my GCC summit 2007 paper 
Multi-stage construction of a global static analyser by Basile Starynkevitch, pages 143 - 152

This directory contains melt files. MELT is a dialect of Lisp compiled
into C code which should be compilable (by the strange melt-cc-script
invoking any GCC [or perhaps even another compiler?] with the
appropriate -fPIC and -I options (and using some melt-private-headers
directory containing the required *.h files from GCC source tree
needed to compile the MELT generated C code).

The MELT source files -a lisp like code- are *.bysl (sorry for the messy suffix).


I am sorry for all this temporary mess. As soon as warm-basilys.bysl
is debugged, it should bootstrap itself in the following sense:

  a *generated* warm-basilys.c exists somewhere; it is quite big (>300KLOC)

  this generated file should be compiled (successfully) by the above
  basilys-gcc script into a warm-basilys.so (to be put in a place to be defined)

  this warm-basilys.so is dynamically loaded by cc1 thru 

 gcc/cc1  -fbasilys -fbasilys-init=warm-basilys.so \
          -fbasilys-command=compileseq -fbasilys-arg=warm-basilys.bysl \
	  -frandom-seed=AbCdEfGhIj

for debugging I usually add the  -fbasilys-debug -fdump-ipa-basilys flags which should not be needed
