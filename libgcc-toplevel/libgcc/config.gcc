# This is the libgcc host-specific configuration file
# where a configuration type is mapped to different system-specific
# definitions and files.  This is invoked by the autoconf-generated
# configure script.  Putting it in a separate shell file lets us skip
# running autoconf when modifying host-specific information.

# This file switches on the shell variable ${host}.

# This file sets the following shell variables for use by the
# autoconf-generated configure script:
#
#  hmake_file		A list of machine-description-specific
#			makefile-fragments, defaulting to
#			"$cpu_type/t-$cpu_type".
#
#  extra_parts		List of extra object files that should be compiled
#			for this host machine.
#

hmake_file=$cpu_type/t-$cpu_type
