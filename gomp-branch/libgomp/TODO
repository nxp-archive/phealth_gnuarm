libgomp
* Introduce a target in the make file for testing purposes (which for the 
  moment can compile and run all the a*c programs).
* Make two targets for the libraries: libgomp_stubs and libgomp.
* Reintroduce the test dir and make some use of the test cases we already
  have.

gcc integration
* Integration with gcc: remove the config dir and add 
  AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR(..) to point to the gcc toplevel.
* Prefix everything with __gomp_, not omp_ or gomp_; we can use weak
  aliases to provide omp_* standard names.
* more?
