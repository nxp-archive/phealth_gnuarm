This directory contains the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) version 3.0.
It includes all of the support for compiling C, C++, Objective C, Fortran,
Java, and Chill.

The GNU Compiler Collection is free software.  See the file COPYING for
copying permission.

See the file gcc.texi (together with other files that it includes)
for installation and porting information.  The directory ../INSTALL
contains copies of the installation information as HTML and plain text.

Installing this package will create various files in subdirectories of
/usr/local/lib, which are passes used by the compiler and a library
named libgcc.a.  It will also create /usr/local/bin/gcc, which is
the user-level command to do a compilation.

See the Bugs chapter of the GCC Manual for how to report bugs
usefully.  An online readable version of the manual is in the files
gcc.info*.

The files pself.c and pself1.c are not part of GCC.
They are programs that print themselves on standard output.
They were written by Dario Dariol and Giovanni Cozzi, and are
included for your hacking pleasure.  Likewise pself2.c
(Who is the author of that?) and pself3.c (by Vlad Taeerov and Rashit
Fakhreyev).
