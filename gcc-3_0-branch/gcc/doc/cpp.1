.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The C preprocessor is a \fImacro processor\fR that is used automatically
by the C compiler to transform your program before actual compilation.
It is called a macro processor because it allows you to define
\&\fImacros\fR, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.
.PP
The C preprocessor is intended only for macro processing of C, \*(C+ and
Objective C source files.  For macro processing of other files, you are
strongly encouraged to use alternatives like M4, which will likely give
you better results and avoid many problems.  For example, normally the C
preprocessor does not preserve arbitrary whitespace verbatim, but
instead replaces each sequence with a single space.
.PP
For use on C-like source files, the C preprocessor provides four
separate facilities that you can use as you see fit:
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Inclusion of header files.  These are files of declarations that can be
substituted into your program.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Macro expansion.  You can define \fImacros\fR, which are abbreviations
for arbitrary fragments of C code, and then the C preprocessor will
replace the macros with their definitions throughout the program.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Conditional compilation.  Using special preprocessing directives, you
can include or exclude parts of the program according to various
conditions.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Line control.  If you use a program to combine or rearrange source files
into an intermediate file which is then compiled, you can use line
control to inform the compiler of where each source line originally came
from.
.PP
C preprocessors vary in some details.  This manual discusses the \s-1GNU\s0 C
preprocessor, which provides a small superset of the features of \s-1ISO\s0
Standard C.
.PP
In its default mode, the \s-1GNU\s0 C preprocessor does not do a few things
required by the standard.  These are features which are rarely, if ever,
used, and may cause surprising changes to the meaning of a program which
does not expect them.  To get strict \s-1ISO\s0 Standard C, you should use the
\&\fB\-std=c89\fR or \fB\-std=c99\fR options, depending on which version
of the standard you want.  To get all the mandatory diagnostics, you
must also use \fB\-pedantic\fR.  
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The C preprocessor expects two file names as arguments, \fIinfile\fR and
\&\fIoutfile\fR.  The preprocessor reads \fIinfile\fR together with any
other files it specifies with \fB#include\fR.  All the output generated
by the combined input files is written in \fIoutfile\fR.
.PP
Either \fIinfile\fR or \fIoutfile\fR may be \fB-\fR, which as
\&\fIinfile\fR means to read from standard input and as \fIoutfile\fR
means to write to standard output.  Also, if either file is omitted, it
means the same as if \fB-\fR had been specified for that file.
.PP
Here is a table of command options accepted by the C preprocessor.
These options can also be given when compiling a C program; they are
passed along automatically to the preprocessor when it is invoked by the
compiler.
.Ip "\fB\-P\fR" 4
.IX Item "-P"
Inhibit generation of \fB#\fR\-lines with line-number information in the
output from the preprocessor.  This might be useful when running the
preprocessor on something that is not C code and will be sent to a
program which might be confused by the \fB#\fR\-lines.  
.Ip "\fB\-C\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C"
Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the output
file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted
along with the directive.  Comments appearing in the expansion list of a
macro will be preserved, and appear in place wherever the macro is
invoked.
.Sp
You should be prepared for side effects when using \fB\-C\fR; it causes
the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.  For
example, macro redefinitions that were trivial when comments were
replaced by a single space might become significant when comments are
retained.  Also, comments appearing at the start of what would be a
directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary
source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a \fB#\fR.
.Ip "\fB\-traditional\fR" 4
.IX Item "-traditional"
Try to imitate the behavior of old-fashioned C, as opposed to \s-1ISO\s0 C.
.RS 4
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Traditional macro expansion pays no attention to single-quote or
double-quote characters; macro argument symbols are replaced by the
argument values even when they appear within apparent string or
character constants.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Traditionally, it is permissible for a macro expansion to end in the
middle of a string or character constant.  The constant continues into
the text surrounding the macro call.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
However, traditionally the end of the line terminates a string or
character constant, with no error.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
In traditional C, a comment is equivalent to no text at all.  (In \s-1ISO\s0
C, a comment counts as whitespace.)
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Traditional C does not have the concept of a ``preprocessing number''.
It considers \fB1.0e+4\fR to be three tokens: \fB1.0e\fR, \fB+\fR,
and \fB4\fR.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
A macro is not suppressed within its own definition, in traditional C.
Thus, any macro that is used recursively inevitably causes an error.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
The character \fB#\fR has no special meaning within a macro definition
in traditional C.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
In traditional C, the text at the end of a macro expansion can run
together with the text after the macro call, to produce a single token.
(This is impossible in \s-1ISO\s0 C.)
.Ip "\(bu" 4
None of the \s-1GNU\s0 extensions to the preprocessor are available in
\&\fB\-traditional\fR mode.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Use the \fB\-traditional\fR option when preprocessing Fortran code, so
that single-quotes and double-quotes within Fortran comment lines (which
are generally not recognized as such by the preprocessor) do not cause
diagnostics about unterminated character or string constants.
.Sp
However, this option does not prevent diagnostics about unterminated
comments when a C-style comment appears to start, but not end, within
Fortran-style commentary.
.Sp
So, the following Fortran comment lines are accepted with
\&\fB\-traditional\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        C This isn't an unterminated character constant
\&        C Neither is "20000000000, an octal constant
\&        C in some dialects of Fortran
.Ve
However, this type of comment line will likely produce a diagnostic, or
at least unexpected output from the preprocessor, due to the
unterminated comment:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        C Some Fortran compilers accept /* as starting
\&        C an inline comment.
.Ve
Note that \f(CW\*(C`g77\*(C'\fR automatically supplies the \fB\-traditional\fR
option when it invokes the preprocessor.  However, a future version of
\&\f(CW\*(C`g77\*(C'\fR might use a different, more-Fortran-aware preprocessor in
place of \f(CW\*(C`cpp\*(C'\fR.
.RE
.Ip "\fB\-trigraphs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-trigraphs"
Process \s-1ISO\s0 standard trigraph sequences.  These are three-character
sequences, all starting with \fB??\fR, that are defined by \s-1ISO\s0 C to
stand for single characters.  For example, \fB??/\fR stands for
\&\fB\e\fR, so \fB'??/n'\fR is a character constant for a newline.  By
default, \s-1GCC\s0 ignores trigraphs, but in standard-conforming modes it
converts them.  See the \fB\-std\fR option.
.Sp
The nine trigraph sequences are
.RS 4
.Ip "\fB??(\fR" 4
.IX Item "??("
-> \fB[\fR
.Ip "\fB??)\fR" 4
.IX Item "??)"
-> \fB]\fR
.Ip "\fB??<\fR" 4
.IX Item "??<"
-> \fB{\fR
.Ip "\fB??>\fR" 4
.IX Item "??>"

.Ip "\fB??'\fR" 4
.IX Item "??'"
-> \fB^\fR
.Ip "\fB??!\fR" 4
.IX Item "??!"
-> \fB|\fR
.Ip "\fB??-\fR" 4
.IX Item "??-"
-> \fB~\fR
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Trigraph support is not popular, so many compilers do not implement it
properly.  Portable code should not rely on trigraphs being either
converted or ignored.
.RE
.Ip "\fB\-pedantic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic"
Issue warnings required by the \s-1ISO\s0 C standard in certain cases such
as when text other than a comment follows \fB#else\fR or \fB#endif\fR.
.Ip "\fB\-pedantic-errors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic-errors"
Like \fB\-pedantic\fR, except that errors are produced rather than
warnings.
.Ip "\fB\-Wcomment\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcomment"
.PD 0
.Ip "\fB\-Wcomments\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcomments"
.PD
(Both forms have the same effect).
Warn whenever a comment-start sequence \fB/*\fR appears in a \fB/*\fR
comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a \fB//\fR comment.
.Ip "\fB\-Wtrigraphs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wtrigraphs"
Warn if any trigraphs are encountered.  This option used to take effect
only if \fB\-trigraphs\fR was also specified, but now works
independently.  Warnings are not given for trigraphs within comments, as
we feel this is obnoxious.
.Ip "\fB\-Wall\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wall"
Requests \fB\-Wcomment\fR and \fB\-Wtrigraphs\fR (but not
\&\fB\-Wtraditional\fR or \fB\-Wundef\fR).
.Ip "\fB\-Wtraditional\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wtraditional"
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
\&\s-1ISO\s0 C.  Also warn about \s-1ISO\s0 C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs which should be avoided.
.RS 4
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body.
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but does not in \s-1ISO\s0 C.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
Traditional preprocessors would only consider a line to be a directive
if the \fB#\fR appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
\&\fB\-Wtraditional\fR warns about directives that traditional C
understands but would ignore because the \fB#\fR does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
\&\fB#pragma\fR not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations would not recognise \fB#elif\fR, so it
suggests avoiding it altogether.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
A function-like macro that appears without arguments.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
The unary plus operator.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
The `U' integer constant suffix.  (Traditonal C does support the `L'
suffix on integer constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros
defined in the system headers of most modern systems, e.g. the _MIN/_MAX
macros in limits.h.  Use of these macros in user code might normally
lead to spurious warnings, however gcc's integrated preprocessor has
enough context to avoid warning in these cases.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.Ip "\fB\-Wundef\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wundef"
Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an \fB#if\fR directive.
.Ip "\fB\-I\fR \fIdirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I directory"
Add the directory \fIdirectory\fR to the head of the list of
directories to be searched for header files.
This can be used to override a system header file, substituting your
own version, since these directories are searched before the system
header file directories.  If you use more than one \fB\-I\fR option,
the directories are scanned in left-to-right order; the standard
system directories come after.
.Ip "\fB\-I-\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I-"
Any directories specified with \fB\-I\fR options before the \fB\-I-\fR
option are searched only for the case of \fB#include "\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR;
they are not searched for \fB#include <\fR\fIfile\fR\fB>\fR.
.Sp
If additional directories are specified with \fB\-I\fR options after
the \fB\-I-\fR, these directories are searched for all \fB#include\fR
directives.
.Sp
In addition, the \fB\-I-\fR option inhibits the use of the current
directory as the first search directory for \fB#include "\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR.
Therefore, the current directory is searched only if it is requested
explicitly with \fB\-I.\fR.  Specifying both \fB\-I-\fR and \fB\-I.\fR
allows you to control precisely which directories are searched before
the current one and which are searched after.
.Ip "\fB\-nostdinc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostdinc"
Do not search the standard system directories for header files.
Only the directories you have specified with \fB\-I\fR options
(and the current directory, if appropriate) are searched.
.Sp
By using both \fB\-nostdinc\fR and \fB\-I-\fR, you can limit the include-file
search path to only those directories you specify explicitly.
.Ip "\fB\-nostdinc++\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostdinc++"
Do not search for header files in the \*(C+\-specific standard directories,
but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option is
used when building the \*(C+ library.)
.Ip "\fB\-remap\fR" 4
.IX Item "-remap"
When searching for a header file in a directory, remap file names if a
file named \fIheader.gcc\fR exists in that directory.  This can be used
to work around limitations of file systems with file name restrictions.
The \fIheader.gcc\fR file should contain a series of lines with two
tokens on each line: the first token is the name to map, and the second
token is the actual name to use.
.Ip "\fB\-D\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D name"
Predefine \fIname\fR as a macro, with definition \fB1\fR.
.Ip "\fB\-D\fR \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIdefinition\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D name=definition"
Predefine \fIname\fR as a macro, with definition \fIdefinition\fR.
There are no restrictions on the contents of \fIdefinition\fR, but if
you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program you
may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect characters such as
spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.  If you use more than
one \fB\-D\fR for the same \fIname\fR, the rightmost definition takes
effect.
.Sp
Any \fB\-D\fR and \fB\-U\fR options on the command line are processed in
order, and always before \fB\-imacros\fR \fIfile\fR, regardless of the
order in which they are written.
.Ip "\fB\-U\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-U name"
Do not predefine \fIname\fR.
.Sp
Any \fB\-D\fR and \fB\-U\fR options on the command line are processed in
order, and always before \fB\-imacros\fR \fIfile\fR, regardless of the
order in which they are written.
.Ip "\fB\-undef\fR" 4
.IX Item "-undef"
Do not predefine any nonstandard macros.
.Ip "\fB\-gcc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gcc"
Define the macros \fI_\|_GNUC_\|_\fR, \fI_\|_GNUC_MINOR_\|_\fR and
\&\fI_\|_GNUC_PATCHLEVEL_\|_\fR. These are defined automatically when you use
\&\fBgcc \-E\fR; you can turn them off in that case with \fB\-no-gcc\fR.
.Ip "\fB\-A\fR \fIpredicate\fR\fB=\fR\fIanswer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A predicate=answer"
Make an assertion with the predicate \fIpredicate\fR and answer
\&\fIanswer\fR.  This form is preferred to the older form \fB\-A\fR
\&\fIpredicate\fR\fB(\fR\fIanswer\fR\fB)\fR, which is still supported, because
it does not use shell special characters.  
.Ip "\fB\-A -\fR\fIpredicate\fR\fB=\fR\fIanswer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A -predicate=answer"
Disable an assertion with the predicate \fIpredicate\fR and answer
\&\fIanswer\fR.  Specifying no predicate, by \fB\-A-\fR or \fB\-A -\fR,
disables all predefined assertions and all assertions preceding it on
the command line; and also undefines all predefined macros and all
macros preceding it on the command line.
.Ip "\fB\-dM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dM"
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a list of
\&\fB#define\fR directives for all the macros defined during the
execution of the preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives
you a way of finding out what is predefined in your version of the
preprocessor; assuming you have no file \fBfoo.h\fR, the command
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h
.Ve
will show the values of any predefined macros.
.Ip "\fB\-dD\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dD"
Like \fB\-dM\fR except in two respects: it does \fInot\fR include the
predefined macros, and it outputs \fIboth\fR the \fB#define\fR
directives and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of output go to
the standard output file.
.Ip "\fB\-dN\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dN"
Like \fB\-dD\fR, but emit only the macro names, not their expansions.
.Ip "\fB\-dI\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dI"
Output \fB#include\fR directives in addition to the result of
preprocessing.
.Ip "\fB\-M\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M"
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR describing the dependencies of the main source
file.  The preprocessor outputs one \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR rule containing the
object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all the
included files, including those coming from \fB\-include\fR or
\&\fB\-imacros\fR command line options.  Unless specified explicitly (with
\&\fB\-MT\fR or \fB\-MQ\fR), the object file name consists of the basename
of the source file with any suffix replaced with object file suffix.
If there are many included files
then the rule is split into several lines using \fB\e\fR\-newline.
.Ip "\fB\-MM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MM"
Like \fB\-M\fR, but mention only the files included with \fB#include
"\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR or with \fB\-include\fR or \fB\-imacros\fR command line
options.  System header files included with \fB#include <\fR\fIfile\fR\fB>\fR
are omitted.
.Ip "\fB\-MF\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MF file"
When used with \fB\-M\fR or \fB\-MM\fR, specifies a file to write the
dependencies to.  This allows the preprocessor to write the preprocessed
file to stdout normally.  If no \fB\-MF\fR switch is given, \s-1CPP\s0 sends
the rules to stdout and suppresses normal preprocessed output.
.Ip "\fB\-MG\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MG"
When used with \fB\-M\fR or \fB\-MM\fR, \fB\-MG\fR says to treat missing
header files as generated files and assume they live in the same
directory as the source file.  It suppresses preprocessed output, as a
missing header file is ordinarily an error.
.Sp
This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.
.Ip "\fB\-MP\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MP"
This option instructs \s-1CPP\s0 to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
dummy rules work around errors \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR gives if you remove header
files without updating the \f(CW\*(C`Makefile\*(C'\fR to match.
.Sp
This is typical output:\-
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        /tmp/test.o: /tmp/test.c /tmp/test.h
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&        /tmp/test.h:

.Ip "\fB\-MQ\fR \fItarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MQ target"
.PD 0
.Ip "\fB\-MT\fR \fItarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MT target"
.PD
By default \s-1CPP\s0 uses the main file name, including any path, and appends
the object suffix, normally ``.o'', to it to obtain the name of the
target for dependency generation.  With \fB\-MT\fR you can specify a
target yourself, overriding the default one.
.Sp
If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single argument
to \fB\-MT\fR, or use multiple \fB\-MT\fR options.
.Sp
The targets you specify are output in the order they appear on the
command line.  \fB\-MQ\fR is identical to \fB\-MT\fR, except that the
target name is quoted for Make, but with \fB\-MT\fR it isn't.  For
example, \-MT '$(objpfx)foo.o' gives
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $(objpfx)foo.o: /tmp/foo.c
.Ve
but \-MQ '$(objpfx)foo.o' gives
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $$(objpfx)foo.o: /tmp/foo.c
.Ve
The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
\&\fB\-MQ\fR.
.Ip "\fB\-H\fR" 4
.IX Item "-H"
Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other normal
activities.
.Ip "\fB\-imacros\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-imacros file"
Process \fIfile\fR as input, discarding the resulting output, before
processing the regular input file.  Because the output generated from
\&\fIfile\fR is discarded, the only effect of \fB\-imacros\fR \fIfile\fR
is to make the macros defined in \fIfile\fR available for use in the
main input.
.Ip "\fB\-include\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-include file"
Process \fIfile\fR as input, and include all the resulting output,
before processing the regular input file.  
.Ip "\fB\-idirafter\fR \fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-idirafter dir"
Add the directory \fIdir\fR to the second include path, marking it as a
system directory.  The directories on the second include path are searched
when a header file is not found in any of the directories in the main
include path (the one that \fB\-I\fR adds to).
.Ip "\fB\-iprefix\fR \fIprefix\fR" 4
.IX Item "-iprefix prefix"
Specify \fIprefix\fR as the prefix for subsequent \fB\-iwithprefix\fR
options.  If the prefix represents a directory, you should include the
final \fB/\fR.
.Ip "\fB\-iwithprefix\fR \fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-iwithprefix dir"
Add a directory to the second include path, marking it as a system
directory.  The directory's name is made by concatenating \fIprefix\fR
and \fIdir\fR, where \fIprefix\fR was specified previously with
\&\fB\-iprefix\fR.
.Ip "\fB\-isystem\fR \fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-isystem dir"
Add a directory to the beginning of the second include path, marking it
as a system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment as
is applied to the standard system directories.  
.Ip "\fB\-x c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x c"
.PD 0
.Ip "\fB\-x c++\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x c++"
.Ip "\fB\-x objective-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x objective-c"
.Ip "\fB\-x assembler-with-cpp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x assembler-with-cpp"
.PD
Specify the source language: C, \*(C+, Objective-C, or assembly.  This has
nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions; it merely
selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none of these options,
cpp will deduce the language from the extension of the source file:
\&\fB.c\fR, \fB.cc\fR, \fB.m\fR, or \fB.S\fR.  Some other common
extensions for \*(C+ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does not
recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the most
generic mode.
.Sp
\&\fBNote:\fR Previous versions of cpp accepted a \fB\-lang\fR option
which selected both the language and the standards conformance level.
This option has been removed, because it conflicts with the \fB\-l\fR
option.
.Ip "\fB\-std=\fR\fIstandard\fR" 4
.IX Item "-std=standard"
.PD 0
.Ip "\fB\-ansi\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ansi"
.PD
Specify the standard to which the code should conform.  Currently cpp
only knows about the standards for C; other language standards will be
added in the future.

.Ip "\fB\-ftabstop=NUMBER\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftabstop=NUMBER"
Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the preprocessor
report correct column numbers in warnings or errors, even if tabs appear
on the line.  Values less than 1 or greater than 100 are ignored.  The
default is 8.
.Ip "\fB\-$\fR" 4
.IX Item "-$"
Forbid the use of \fB$\fR in identifiers.  The C standard allows
implementations to define extra characters that can appear in
identifiers.  By default the \s-1GNU\s0 C preprocessor permits \fB$\fR, a
common extension.
