   The behavior is that the type written for a bitfield ('int',

   entire structure, as if the structure really did contain an
   ordinary field of that type.  In addition, the bitfield is placed
   within the structure so that it would fit within such a field,
   not crossing a boundary for it.

   would not cross a four-byte boundary, and would force four-byte
   alignment for the whole structure.  (The alignment used may not

   must be defined so that any pseudo-register that has not been

   with no hard register must be rejected.

   and an integer are stored inside a 'const' RTX to mark them as
   constant.  Therefore, there is no need to recognize such sums
   specifically as legitimate addresses.  Normally you would simply
   recognize any 'const' as legitimate.

   Usually 'PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS' is not prepared to handle constant
   sums that are not marked with 'const'.  It assumes that a naked
   'plus' indicates indexing.  If so, then you *must* reject such
