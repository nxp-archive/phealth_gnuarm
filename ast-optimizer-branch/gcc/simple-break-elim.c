/* This pass eliminates all BREAK_STMTs and CONTINUE_STMTs from loops.  
   It performs also dead code elimination.  This pass works on double linked
   statements on the SIMPLE representation.
   After this pass we obtain a subset of the SIMPLE grammar since all 
   SWITCH_STMTs are trasformed into IF_STMTs.  */

/* For normalizing the flow in the loop body, there are two approaches :
   Solution 1: copy statements (explicit control flow).
   Solution 2: use logical variables (data controled flow).

   The first solution raises a difficult problem linked to the visibility of a
   variable in different scopes.  

   The second solution is similar to the one adopted by the McCAT compiler for 
   eliminating GOTO_STMTs.  They describe an algorithm for eliminating goto 
   statements, but they use BREAK_STMTs for exiting loops.  The following 
   implementation is an extension of their algorithm and is based on the same 
   principle : the use of logical variables for controlling the control flow.

/* Solution 2: DATA_CONTROLED_FLOW
   use logical variables to decide wether the code following 
   the CONTINUE_STMT in the parent block will be executed or not.
   This solution avoids to expand the code, but the control flow 
   is no more explicit since the control depends on the logical 
   variables : we transformed the control flow in a data flow.
   This is the solution adopted by the McCAT compiler.  

   Example : "while (c) {s1; s2; continue; s3;}"
   Calling continue_stmt_solution2 (continue);
   transforms the previous while into the following :
   "while (c) {s1; s2;}"  if "s3;" doesn't contain LABEL_STMTs (entry points),
   "while (c) {s1; s2; if (1 == 0) {s3;}"  otherwise.  
   
   Example : "while (c1) {s1; if (c2) {s2; continue; s3;} s4;}"
   Calling continue_stmt_solution2 (continue);
   transforms the previous while into the following :
   "while (c1) {int t=0; s1; if (c2) {s2; t=1;} if (t==0) {s4;}}"

   LAST_EXECUTED is the last statement that the caller wants to be executed in
