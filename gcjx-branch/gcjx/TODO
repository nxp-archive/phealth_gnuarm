sometimes we emit the wrong line numbers with -g
see test case in kaffe

error message if 'enum' is used as an identifier could be better

use a using declaration to resolve overrides in
various MI cases.

make sure we don't resolve too many classes
see email around Mar 28 2005 on the gcj list

we could free the 'flags' associated with a model_bytecode_block
after we've generated code for that method

in some places we check both inner_p() and static_context_p()
on a class.  this is lame, we should mark the class static
in a static context

gcjx also fails on PR 19629, though differently
it creates the anonymous constructor incorrectly

right now we use mmap() for reading files
we should optionally use read() or fread()

in a few places in the bytecode back end we
add_utf(...->get_descriptor()).  this fails if the class is a member
instead we need a new method on the constant pool

there's a bug with implicit qualifiers for field references.
qualification in general needs some inspection.
eg, for 'Foo.super.field', 'Foo.super' should probably be a qualifying
expression, not part of the field reference itself.

we initialize fields that were added by variable capture
even when the constructor calls this().  this is wrong
we could fix this by attaching the assignments to the super() call
instead of adding them to each constructor
then they simply wouldn't show up for a this() call

we give the wrong line number for a malformed utf-8 character :-(

we could save some more memory by clearing field initializers
for non-constant fields after generating code for a class.
interleaving code generation and analysis some more would probably
also help.

model_catch should accept a model_catch_decl only

the special code that knows that a private member of an outer
class can't be accessed via inheritance must also handle the
case where a package-private member is "not inherited" via a superclass
in a different package; see jacks test 6.5.6.1-explicit-constructor-5
It may be more clear for name lookup to record the path by which
lookup succeeded.

the ugly code in model_class::resolve_classes for .class files
has to be even uglier: we need to push type parameters as well.
But, we only want to do this when it is correct.

Elliott's fix to method_conversion_p() on 2004-12-06 may point
to some other lurking bug in that method; investigate

do we do the right thing if we override one abstract method with
another, where both come from classes (not interfaces), and they have
conflicting `throws'?

change method to accept a list of parameters,
not variables

must really implement capture conversion
there are similar little hacks in other places
widening conversion is now officially a mess
have to do a real pass to solidify this stuff

we can get rid of model_field_base and ambiguous field handling

rewrite jcf-dump
would be convenient to have a mode to disassemble in jasmin format
would also be convenient to have an assembler
Elliott suggests:
- print floating point values as hex integers
- quote strings as they would appear in the source
[ this task probably doesn't belong in gcjx but instead perhaps
  in classpath tools.  or just use jasmin and other existing tools ]

it is invalid to look up a cached class while parsing
the compiler ought to enforce this with asserts

some forms of boxing still don't work
see model_prefix_simple::resolve
model_prefix_side_effect::resolve
model_postfix::resolve
side-effecting pre/post-fix operators with unboxing will require
special code generation.  e.g.:
    Integer x = 0; ++x;
We must write Jacks tests for all this!

must gettextize

for common errors, have a section in the manual explaining them
then have gcjx emit a URL in the error message
user can click to see what to do

we're introducing unnecessary casts in maybe_wrap.
eg when called from assignment_conversion(BaseClass, DerivedClass)

accessors don't work properly with String +=.

make sure we aren't susceptible to PR 17733
a leading "./" in jar file names confused gcj

note that a jar reader could be shared
by multiple compiler instances.  implement this...?

give a real error if encoding is not found

`import' needs to use the canonical name
we have to implement this by adding a flag to classify_type_name()
that indicates we only want canonical names.

ext/dtoa.c has some #define tweaks we could apply
we probably need to depending on host
... note also that this version of dtoa is known to have some bugs;
see classpath bugzilla for details

Ranjit points out that some places we use ref_* where we needn't.
eg, get_this_0() returns a ref_field but should return model_field*

assert fails since we do the wrong thing when resolving it.
we need to create assert members earlier
creating them when resolving an assert statement would work ok,
but we would need special handling when the only assert statement
is in <clinit>

right now we don't complain if we try to load `x.y.z', find x/y/z.java,
but the file has the wrong package statement

comment from gcc/java/parse.y:
      /* We write out the classes in reverse order.  This ensures that
	 inner classes are written before their containing classes,
	 which is important for parallel builds.  Otherwise, the
	 class file for the outer class may be found, but the class
	 file for the inner class may not be present.  In that
	 situation, the compiler cannot fall back to the original
	 source, having already read the outer class, so we must
	 prevent that situation.  */
We probably need to do something like this

for interfaces we can't generate class$.  instead compilers build
a new inner class and put it there.  should we?  we could just
inline the code in <clinit>, couldn't we?

it would be nice to do coverage analysis of the code
this is easy, just rebuild it correctly and run classpath
and a couple other things through it
(classpath exercises most but not all language constructs.  ecj is a
good additional source.)

cpool is deleted when class reader is destroyed
this is wrong... reference count or pass on to compilation unit

abort() isn't very friendly since it doesn't print a message
we should use assert(0) instead
in a similar vein sometimes it would be nice to have the
"current location" in an assertion message, could have a new
macro and method on element

why is there a model_block in a for loop's update slot?

perhaps we should compute can-complete-normally as a side effect of
resolution?  how does that interact with resolving unreachable
statements?  do we care?

our visitor API could probably benefit from a way to express scopes
explicitly, so we don't have to remember to handle them in every
visitor.  we could do this by:
* introduce IVisitable
* for something like `for', have it call visit_scope(), and pass in
  a new visitor stub which is called into later; this stub just
  re-visits the parts of the `for'
[ this is very low priority as we already have a hoc solutions in place ]

use slist<> instead of list<> to save space?
also, bkoz says that list<> is slow

error to reference a member of a type variable with more than one bound
unless member is accessible member of Object

model_class::member_p() looks wrong; check it

should see if a package exists.  perhaps by testing to see if its
directory exists on classpath?  see what jikes/jdk/etc do...
this could be used to give better messages in name.cc

model_forwarding_type should probably be a subclass of type
then we can remove model_forwarding_resolved entirely
(or can we?  are there error reports that we need?)
could measure to see how much this saves, by instrumenting
the model_forwarding_resolved constructors

outpool::add(string) and outpool::add_utf() have the wrong names.
add_utf() is used more and should be plain add()

in gcc a declaration can also be used as a variable reference.
the idea is, having all those extra reference objects is
wasteful.  we could try this... but is it true?  we would
need to do variable lookups at parse time for this to work
out, wouldn't we?  Or perhaps replace the forwarding references
in the AST (there's no support for this atm)

we don't handle the case where a local class captures
a variable and then there is another local or anonymous
class that extends the first class

what does gcj do if we compile:
  aconst_null
  invokespecial Object.<init> ()
[ this is a verification error, we should reject ]

need error checking for super() when this class is static but
superclass is not... in this case must require expr.super(), not an
additional argument to super().  we should probably share some code
between `new', super() and this(), in particular code for determining
enclosing instances, etc

must write dependency-tracking code.  green suggests being able to
write a list of files to package up for some distcc-like action.  we
could feed that to jar and ship it off to a remote gcj with the jar as
the sole class path entry. we could even generate the jar file
ourselves.

during code generation we might need to generate access$foo methods
and use them.  might this not also mean introducing this$1, etc?
if so then we will need a special case in the analysis code to do this
before code generation begins, since it is too hard to add new
parameters and such after we've possibly generated code to call
constructors

need a way to add duplicate declarations to an error message; this
occurs in several places

we may need a method to resolve a single field in a class
elements should probably track their own resolution status

functions in name.hh should take a location, not an element,
as the request object.  that way they can work properly when
reading .class files

the modifier class is a bit strange
we should probably rewrite to make it more like ordinary
model classes

name.cc is very inefficient
it should probably be rewritten in a more intelligent way

factory code can go in its own subdir?

performance is already a major problem :-(

assignment expression parsing is just broken

standardize error messages
what do they refer to?  (what is wrong or what should be)
voice, etc

one thing that would be nice would be to unify the visitor API
with the constant value computation stuff, so we'd only need a single
implementation of the logic in the model.

================================================================

header generation

X must handle Miranda methods properly
X must implement gcjh hacks for C++ keywords and method/field name
  clash
X must implement gcjh hack for field alignment
X implement the write-to-temp file thing that bytecode uses?
  gcjh doesn't, perhaps we don't need this
  [ we don't because we build all the headers before any .cc files ]
X gcjh has options to add text to the header in different places;
  we need this

================================================================

Tree generation

compiling Class with -g -O2 fails
cgraph complains about the native methods

we have '.zero 2' at the end of a utf8const ... why?
old gcj has '.zero 1'

for BC mode we aren't emitting [ao]table refs with
the qualifying type

when compiling bytecode, an error in the bytecode doesn't seem
to result in the compiler doing exit(1).  why?
eg:
    opsy. gcj -c HelloWorld.class
    error: expected CONSTANT_Class tag at index '9'
    opsy. echo $?
    0

when doing 'String +' we emit explicit null pointer checks
in this case this is useless

no need to do InitClass in a 'class$' method?
why are we even generating these for .o files?

see Wilson's note on 2005-08-10
CHAR_TYPE is preferable for char types

use set_decl_assembler_name lang hook instead of mangling up front

we should add an abi method that detemrines if a class needs
initialization.  we could then omit init. calls in some cases (c++ abi):
when there are no initializers or String constants in the class
we could also pre-initialize some classes in libgcj

should we use PLACEHOLDER_EXPR when dealing with array types?

put _Jv_ThrowNoSuchMethodError into vtable for abstract methods
  [ done ]
could pass in method and class name too...

is there a way to emit 'import' statements into the debug info?
this would let gdb do a better job of name lookup

look at
http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/gcc/gcc/java/class.c.diff?cvsroot=gcc&r1=1.222&r2=1.223


when generating a CNI .h from a .java file, we could translate java to
c++ directly.

things to do in a merge:
- start using fold_buildN()
- handle -fno-show-column

things to document about trees:
- you are *required* to set DECL_ARG_TYPE
  though it seems like this could be an ABI setting, and GCC
  could set it for the FE.  why must the FE handle promotion?
- TRY_CATCH_EXPR cannot have an empty catch block
- having a NULL type for a SWITCH_EXPR causes a crash,
  despite what tree.def says
- CALL_EXPR requires the address of the function
- DECL_INITIAL is not sufficient for local variables, instead you
  need to emit MODIFY_EXPRs for them.  Actually, it turns out
  that DECL_INITIAL is used if you have a DECL_EXPR for the variable
- instead of save_expr() for a complex LHS of an assignment,
  use stabilize_reference.
- Set TREE_USED on a BLOCK to indicate that debug info should be
  generated for variables in the block

we should use explicit temporaries instead of save_expr

DECL_EXTERNAL stuff needs some work
sometimes it should be, sometimes not

the verifier needs a mode to be more lazy
but not always...
in this situation should put a type assertion in the class

we should factor out things like object layout, etc, so that
we can reuse the bulk of this code with LLVM
  [ done ]

we must generate an array store check for something like:
  Object[] x;  x[0] = something;
gcj cleverly omits the check if we know that `something' came from `x'.
however, we ought to be able to do better with tree-ssa
might be a good example of when FE knowledge is needed later...?
can we express the array check in a statically checkable way?

look to see how IMA works in C
in particular how are the command line arguments handled?
did we miss a sharing opportunity?

These are optimization -vs- code-size checks
- should we inline the null checks for instanceof?
- should we turn checkcast into explicit instanceof/throw?
- should we call _jv_divi or generate inline checks?
... one idea would be to have a pass after all SSA optimizations
that then further lowers things like _jv_divi, or changes explicit
instanceof/throw back into checkcast.  the latter would be hard?

X use the new buildN interfaces
X must set flag_evaluation_order
X ensure that Class and Object don't have any instance fields
  declared in Java.  Static fields are ok though.
X TYPE_NONALIASED_COMPONENT - important!
  [ pretty sure we're done with this one.  not clear we can
    apply it to the "data" field of a java array type ]

TREE_THIS_NOTRAP is important...
use whenever we're certain an indirect can't trap
we should just disallow build(INDIRECT_REF...) -- and force use of
one wrapper or another


must share code between both code generation engines.
eg, only implement the ABI differences once

we could have a separate atable slot for each class referenced
by `new' that we would use to store the appropriate allocator.
this would let us continue to avoid finalizer and other penalties.
Equivalently we could give each class its own allocator method
that we could call

what is TYPE_VFIELD ?
and add the abort() to tree.c:find_compatible_field()

when generating old ABI code, we should ensure that java.lang.Object
comes from libgcj.  In other cases, it doesn't matter, and we should
let it slide.  Also, when generating old ABI code, we should ensure
that old-ABI-ness holds for all other classes where it matters (eg our
hierarchy, maybe classes we call too?)

search gcc for references to 'java'
sometimes it claims that gcj does bad things
we can fix these or remove the comments
not all of these things are well-explained

very random thought: we could have a tree-generating back end that
generates trees the way that g++ likes.  then you could directly
#include <foo.class>, and we could eliminate gcjh and perhaps its
various limitations.
- update on this idea: you would just #include <fully.qualified.name>
  and let gcjx decide whether to read a class file or parse a java file

Another random thought: we could have a GDirect ("pinvoke") -like mode
where we directly generate native code that calls functions in some C
library.
look at jikesrvm's approach to this

right now we put the vtable index into the otable
but why not put the byte index in there?
saves a multiply

think about changing a private method to non-private
does it affect the invocation mode?

we have to handle super() calls differently in BC
they need a special slot.
there is a PR for this


================================================================

we could have some simple java source generation tools
based on gcjx.  E.g., a tool to generate a stub class based on some
superclass and superinterfaces, with flags saying what methods to
add: say implementations of abstract methods and constructors.
Then you could add a M-x command to Emacs to make it easy to
write certain kinds of new classes

================================================================

See this quote from the D programming language

  The need for compiler warnings is symptomatic of poor language
  design.

In gcjx we take a different point of view, namely that warnings can
help you catch situations where you did something you did not intend,
or where you are violating what has come to be considered good style.


should we allow unconditional warnings?  [no]
there are some currently

perhaps our SuppressWarnings strings should all start with "gcj-"?
or have a form that starts with that?


Warnings to emit:

X use of deprecated class/method/field
X unused import
- look at jikes
X use of static member in non-static context
- optionally print reference URL in messages?

X use of "$" in an identifier
X warn if an ascii character is represented by \u

- if a parameter `x' shadows a field `x', (optionally) emit a warning
  if we assign to the parameter x.  usually this is a bug
X type and permissions of serialVersionUID
  (are there any other magic fields?)
- check types and such of magic serialization methods
- don't emit "unused" warning for serialization methods
  [ got two of them, make a full list... ]
  [ also don't emit this for default constructors ]
- don't emit "unused" warning for anything in a serializable class?
X check that serialization fields occur in class which is actually serializable
- check that serialization methods occur in class which
  is actually serializable
X require serialVersionUID in serializable class
- Shouldn't override ClassLoader.loadClass()
- clone() doesn't call super.clone()
- a `static final' method doesn't make much sense
X warn if a case in a switch falls through
X equivalents of gcc's -Wswitch, -Wswitch-default
  (-Wswitch-enum doesn't make sense for us)
- String comparison with '=='
- array comparison with equals() and not Arrays.equals()

- unneeded `throws' in method decl.
- overly general `throws' in method decl (shadows other decl)

- use of com.sun.* or sun.* !

- type variable bound already implied by another bound
- useless cast, eg byte to int

- warn about a private inner class with a public constructor
  this is actually accessible at runtime
- have a separate flag controlling the need for a trampoline
  method when the access is to an inherited protected member

- Mark suggests a warning for code like:
     long var = <int> * <int>
  ... "did you mean to cast to long...?"
  basically when the lhs of an assignment has a wider type than the rhs

From eclipse 2:

X unreachable code
    I think this one is done... are there other places?
- unresolvable import statement
X unused local variable
X unused parameter
X unused import
- unused private type/method/field
  [ note unused private no-arg constructor is still ok if there
    are no non-private constructors ]
  [ this works for field and method, but for types we don't
    mark them as used yet ]
- use of non-externalized strings (!?)
X use of deprecated API
- ... use of deprecated API inside deprecated code
- methods overridden but not package visible (?)
X methods with a constructor name
- conflict of iface method with protected Object method
X hidden catch blocks
X non-static access to static member
X access to non-accessible member of enclosing class
X assignment with no effect  (x = x)
X using a char array in string concat

From Eclipse 3:

- indirect access to static member (?)
- possible accidental boolean assignment  if (a = b)
    when to emit this and when not?  if (a = (b > 5)) looks ok
X `finally' does not complete normally
- undocumented empty block
- local variable decl hides field or variable
- ... include constructor or setter method parameters
- field decl hides field or variable
- unqualified access to instance field
    does this support some standard coding style?
- signal overriding or implementing deprecated method
  [ should @deprecated be inherited?  probably so ... ]
- unnecessary semicolon
- unnecessary cast
X unnecessary instanceof
- unnecessary decl of thrown checked exception
- ... check overriding and implementing methods
X unnecessary else (`then' clause can't complete normally)

mjw suggests:

X Are you sure you want to override finalise and not finaliZe?
  [ users can use @Override too ]
- a visible field with a non-visible type
  a visible method with a non-visible return/argument/throws type
  also type parameter bounds?

from jikes:

- warn if a constant isn't spelled like one
X constant shift count too large for type
  (or negative...)

from Effective Java book, according to jikes list
http://www-124.ibm.com/pipermail/jikes/2004-February/002679.html
- empty catch block
- empty finally block
- accidental overloading of `equals'
- implementing `equals' but not `hashCode'
- missing private constructors to prevent instantiation
- overly-general throws clauses
- public static final array fields
- return null instead of a zero-length array
- deviations from standard naming conventions

- warn if wait() is used outside of a loop
  [ I think this comes from Effective Java ]


- find a way to run FindBugs from inside the compiler
  writing a separate "back end" to do warning checks based on some
  kind of xml descriptor would be possible and easy

- I see code like this a fair amount:
  int x = (bytes[i] << 24) | (bytes[i+1] << 16) | ...
  this has a sign extension bug.
  warning about this might be nice

- warn if an exception is created in a catch context but
  initCause is not called

================================================================

test

   if ((boolean) x) { ... }


================================================================

parsing

on irc bosch suggests doing what gnat does, tracking indentation
automatically and then using that to emit better errors.
eg, if you see new indentation and then later an extra "}",
you can emit an error at the suspicious indentation change.
likewise for "{"

================================================================

Bytecode generation

we could recognize adjacent catch clauses with empty bodies and point
them all to the same bytecode block

Most verifiers can't verify the code generated by most compilers for
this code:

    public class three
    {
      public static int foo (boolean b)
      {
	int i;
	try {
	    if (b) return 1;
	    i= 2;
	}
	finally {
	  if (b) i = 3;
	}
	return i;
      }
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
      }
    }

We can avoid this by never generating jsr/ret opcodes.  Instead we
should just inline finally clauses where needed.  This can mean
bytecode explosion in some cases :-(.  Also it makes local variable
scoping difficult.

================================================================

I looked at file sizes of .class files, in particular the class files
from rhug, Eclipse, and libgcj.  You end up with a nice logarithmic
plot.  The largest number of class files are less than 1000 bytes,
about half as many as that less than 2000 bytes, and so on up to 10000
bytes where the graph flattens out.

Is this interesting?  Maybe not.

[ redo this and record the actual results, it is useful sometimes ]

================================================================

Improvements over gcj

for local classes we will only capture the variables actually used by
the class; gcj will capture all final local variables

in theory our byte code will be a bit better:
* we won't generate dead code
* we can generate 1.5 bytecode
* we won't generate jsr/ret (more programs will verify)
* we can peephole optimize some things gcj can't

we have much better warnings already, with more to come

will be able to write class files, header files, and object code
all at once.  internal representation doesn't depend on target

much better correctness.  we fail fewer jacks tests

see http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16927
this is a classic gcj front end bug
gcjx basically isn't susceptible to this sort of thing, due
to static typing

see http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14853
another classic gcj bug, caused by generating different
trees depending on the target
