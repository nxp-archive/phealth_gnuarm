/* Given a set of newly created SSA names (NEW_NAMES) and a set of
   existing SSA names (OLD_NAMES), update the SSA form so that:

   1- The names in OLD_NAMES dominated by the definitions of
      NEW_NAMES are all re-written to be reached by the
      appropriate definition from NEW_NAMES.

   2- If needed, new PHI nodes are added to the iterated dominance
      frontier of the blocks where each of NEW_NAMES are defined.

   The two input vectors should be arranged so that for every I,
   OLD_NAMES[I] is replaced with NEW_NAMES[I].

   This function is useful when inserting new statements that generate
   new SSA names for GIMPLE registers.  Since SSA names for GIMPLE
   registers may have overlapping live ranges, it is not possible to
   just mark the base symbol for rewriting.  We would have to take the
   symbol out of SSA form and rename all uses of it.  That is
   expensive.

   Instead, the caller identifies the new names that have been
   inserted and the names that need to be replaced.  Note that the
   function assumes that the new names have already been inserted in
   the IL.  All this function does is rewire the use-def chains for
   the names in OLD_NAMES so that they use the names in
   NEW_NAMES.

   For instance, given the following code:

     1	L0:
     2	x_1 = PHI (0, x_5)
     3	if (x_1 < 10)
     4	  if (x_1 > 7)
     5	    y_2 = 0
     6	  else
     7	    y_3 = x_1 + x_7
     8	  endif
     9	  x_5 = x_1 + 1
     10   goto L0;
     11	endif

   Suppose that we insert new names x_10 and x_11 (lines 4 and 8).

     1	L0:
     2	x_1 = PHI (0, x_5)
     3	if (x_1 < 10)
     4	  x_10 = ...
     5	  if (x_1 > 7)
     6	    y_2 = 0
     7	  else
     8	    x_11 = ...
     9	    y_3 = x_1 + x_7
     10	  endif
     11	  x_5 = x_1 + 1
     12	  goto L0;
     13	endif

   We want to replace all the uses of x_1 with the new definitions of
   x_10 and x_11.  Note that the only uses that should be replaced are
   those at lines 5, 9 and 11.  Also, the use of x_7 at line 9 should
   *not* be replaced (this is why we cannot just mark symbol 'x' for
   renaming).

   Additionally, we may need to insert a PHI node at line 11 because
   that is a merge point for x_10 and x_11.  So the use of x_1 at line
   11 will be replaced with the new PHI node.  The insertion of PHI
   nodes is optional.  They are not strictly necessary to preserve the
   SSA form, and depending on what the caller inserted, they may not
   even be useful for the optimizers.  If INSERT_PHI_P is true, then
   PHI nodes are inserted as necessary, otherwise they are not.  */
