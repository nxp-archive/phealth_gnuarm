/* TODO
   - reordering of memory allocation and freeing to be more space efficient
   - do rough calc of how many regs are needed in each block, and a rough
     calc of how many regs are available in each class and use that to
     throttle back the code in cases where RTX_COST is minimal.
   - a store to the same address as a load does not kill the load if the
     source of the store is also the destination of the load.  Handling this
     allows more load motion, particularly out of loops.
   - ability to realloc sbitmap vectors would allow one initial computation
     of reg_set_in_block with only subsequent additions, rather than
     recomputing it for each pass

/* Propagate flow information through back edges and thus enable PRE's
   moving loop invariant calculations out of loops.

   Originally this tended to create worse overall code, but several
   improvements during the development of PRE seem to have made following
   back edges generally a win.

   Note much of the loop invariant code motion done here would normally
   be done by loop.c, which has more heuristics for when to move invariants
   out of loops.  At some point we might need to move some of those
   heuristics into gcse.c.  */

/* We support GCSE via Partial Redundancy Elimination.  PRE optimizations
   are a superset of those done by GCSE.

   We perform the following steps:

   1) Compute basic block information.

   2) Compute table of places where registers are set.

   3) Perform copy/constant propagation.

   4) Perform global cse.

   5) Perform another pass of copy/constant propagation.

   Two passes of copy/constant propagation are done because the first one
   enables more GCSE and the second one helps to clean up the copies that
   GCSE creates.  This is needed more for PRE than for Classic because Classic
   GCSE will try to use an existing register containing the common
   subexpression rather than create a new one.  This is harder to do for PRE
   because of the code motion (which Classic GCSE doesn't do).

   Expressions we are interested in GCSE-ing are of the form
   (set (pseudo-reg) (expression)).
   Function want_to_gcse_p says what these are.

   PRE handles moving invariant expressions out of loops (by treating them as
   partially redundant).

   Eventually it would be nice to replace cse.c/gcse.c with SSA (static single
   assignment) based GVN (global value numbering).  L. T. Simpson's paper
   (Rice University) on value numbering is a useful reference for this.

   **********************

   We used to support multiple passes but there are diminishing returns in
   doing so.  The first pass usually makes 90% of the changes that are doable.
   A second pass can make a few more changes made possible by the first pass.
   Experiments show any further passes don't make enough changes to justify
   the expense.

   A study of spec92 using an unlimited number of passes:
   [1 pass] = 1208 substitutions, [2] = 577, [3] = 202, [4] = 192, [5] = 83,
   [6] = 34, [7] = 17, [8] = 9, [9] = 4, [10] = 4, [11] = 2,
   [12] = 2, [13] = 1, [15] = 1, [16] = 2, [41] = 1

   It was found doing copy propagation between each pass enables further
   substitutions.

   PRE is quite expensive in complicated functions because the DFA can take
   awhile to converge.  Hence we only perform one pass.  The parameter max-gcse-passes can
   be modified if one wants to experiment.

   **********************

   The steps for PRE are:

   1) Build the hash table of expressions we wish to GCSE (expr_hash_table).

   2) Perform the data flow analysis for PRE.

   3) Delete the redundant instructions

   4) Insert the required copies [if any] that make the partially
      redundant instructions fully redundant.

   5) For other reaching expressions, insert an instruction to copy the value
      to a newly created pseudo that will reach the redundant instruction.

   The deletion is done first so that when we do insertions we
   know which pseudo reg to use.

   Various papers have argued that PRE DFA is expensive (O(n^2)) and others
   argue it is not.  The number of iterations for the algorithm to converge
   is typically 2-4 so I don't view it as that expensive (relatively speaking).

   PRE GCSE depends heavily on the second CSE pass to clean up the copies
   we create.  To make an expression reach the place where it's redundant,
   the result of the expression is copied to a new register, and the redundant
   expression is deleted by replacing it with this new register.  Classic GCSE
   doesn't have this problem as much as it computes the reaching defs of
   each register in each block and thus can try to use an existing register.

   **********************

   A fair bit of simplicity is created by creating small functions for simple
   tasks, even when the function is only called in one place.  This may
   measurably slow things down [or may not] by creating more function call
   overhead than is necessary.  The source is laid out so that it's trivial
   to make the affected functions inline so that one can measure what speed
   up, if any, can be achieved, and maybe later when things settle things can
   be rearranged.
