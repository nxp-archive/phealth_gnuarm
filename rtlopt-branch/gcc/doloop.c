/* This module is used to modify loops with a determinable number of
   iterations to use special low-overhead looping instructions.

   It first validates whether the loop is well behaved and has a
   determinable number of iterations (either at compile or run-time).
   It then modifies the loop to use a low-overhead looping pattern as
   follows:

   1. A pseudo register is allocated as the loop iteration counter.

   2. The number of loop iterations is calculated and is stored
      in the loop counter.

   3. At the end of the loop, the jump insn is replaced by the
      doloop_end pattern.  The compare must remain because it might be
      used elsewhere.  If the loop-variable or condition register are
      used elsewhere, they will be eliminated by flow.

   4. An optional doloop_begin pattern is inserted at the top of the
      loop.

	 If the loop is executed only a few times an extra check to
	 restart the loop could use up most of the benefits of using a
