	* include/bits/stl_tree.h (struct _Rb_tree_impl): Change the
	_M_key_compare member to a function, so that the _M_impl's member
	can be accessed with equal ease for either the normal version, or
	the specialization for PODs - this reduces the size of the red-black
	tree by 4-bytes for optimizable struct comparators; tweak consistently
	all users.
